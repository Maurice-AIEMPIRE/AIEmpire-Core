# Projects

Active project tracking and documentation.

## Purpose
- Track current projects and their status
- Store project-specific assets and notes
- Maintain project history for reference

## Structure
Each project gets its own subdirectory:
```
projects/
├── <project-name>/
│   ├── BRIEF.md        # Project brief and requirements
│   ├── STATUS.md       # Current status and blockers
│   ├── NOTES.md        # Working notes and decisions
│   └── assets/         # Project-specific files
```

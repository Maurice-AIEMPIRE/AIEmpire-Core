# Kimi Swarm Configuration
# Adjust these values to configure max agent spawning capacity

# 100K Swarm Configuration
swarm_100k:
  total_agents: 100000      # Maximum agent capacity
  max_concurrent: 50        # Concurrent workers (increase for faster processing, but watch rate limits)
  budget_usd: 15.0         # Budget limit in USD
  batch_delay: 0.5         # Delay between batches in seconds
  
  # Rate limiting recommendations
  # - max_concurrent: 50  → Safe, minimal rate limiting
  # - max_concurrent: 100 → Moderate, some rate limiting possible
  # - max_concurrent: 200 → Aggressive, expect rate limiting

# 500K Swarm Configuration  
swarm_500k:
  total_agents: 500000      # Maximum agent capacity (5x of 100K)
  max_concurrent: 500       # Concurrent workers (10x of 100K)
  budget_usd: 75.0         # Budget limit in USD (5x of 100K)
  batch_delay: 0.1         # Faster batches with better concurrency
  claude_orchestration_interval: 1000  # Claude review every N tasks
  
  # Rate limiting recommendations
  # - max_concurrent: 200  → Conservative, minimal rate limiting
  # - max_concurrent: 500  → Balanced (default), some rate limiting
  # - max_concurrent: 1000 → Aggressive, expect rate limiting

# Output Configuration
output:
  base_dir: output_500k     # Base output directory
  create_subdirs: true      # Auto-create subdirectories
  
  # Subdirectories for different task types

# API Configuration (set via environment variables)
# Required:
#   - MOONSHOT_API_KEY: Kimi/Moonshot API key
# Optional:
#   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Claude API key for orchestration (fallback to rule-based if not set)

# Performance Tuning
performance:
  retry_attempts: 3         # Number of retries per failed task
  timeout_seconds: 60       # Request timeout
  
  # Exponential backoff for rate limiting
  backoff_base: 2           # Base for exponential backoff (2^attempt)
  backoff_jitter: 1.0       # Random jitter to add (0-1 seconds)

# Monitoring
monitoring:
  stats_interval: 10        # Print stats every N batches
  save_intermediate_stats: true  # Save stats during run
  progress_updates: true    # Enable progress updates

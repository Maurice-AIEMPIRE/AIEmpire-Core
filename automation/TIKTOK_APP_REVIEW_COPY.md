## App Review Text (paste into "Explain how each product and scope works")
AI Empire Shorts is a creator workflow tool for educational short videos.
Users connect their TikTok account via OAuth (Authorization Code + PKCE).
After consent, we receive an access token and only call TikTok APIs needed for upload and publish.

Scope usage:
- user.info.basic: show connected account name/avatar in settings so the user can verify the correct account.
- video.upload: upload the selected local MP4 generated by our workflow.
- video.publish: create a post draft or direct publish after user confirmation in our UI.
- video.list (if enabled): show recent posts for performance feedback and duplicate prevention.

Data handling:
- Tokens are stored server-side in encrypted environment secrets.
- Users can revoke access at any time from TikTok settings.
- We do not sell personal data.
- We only process creator-selected video files and post metadata.

User flow shown in demo video:
1. User opens AI Empire Shorts dashboard.
2. User clicks "Connect TikTok" and completes TikTok OAuth.
3. User selects one generated short.
4. User uploads and publishes via TikTok API.
5. User sees publish status and recent post list.

## Demo Video Checklist (must show)
1. Sandbox app + same domain as provided URLs.
2. OAuth consent flow end-to-end.
3. Upload of one MP4 via API.
4. Publish success/status response.
5. Optional: listing the posted video in app UI.

## Important
- If Terms/Privacy URLs are not live yet, publish them first; review will be delayed otherwise.
- Do not request scopes you do not demonstrate in demo.

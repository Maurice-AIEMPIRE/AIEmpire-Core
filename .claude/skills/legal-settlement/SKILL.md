# L07: LEGAL SETTLEMENT/NEGOTIATION STRATEGIST

## Purpose
Develops negotiation strategy, defines BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement), identifies the zone of possible agreement, and prepares talking points.

## Triggers
- Risk report completed
- User decides to explore settlement
- Negotiation meeting scheduled

## Inputs
- `legal/strategy/RISK_REPORT.md`
- `legal/strategy/OPPONENT_ANALYSIS.md`
- `legal/claims/CLAIM_MATRIX.md`

## Output
`legal/strategy/SETTLEMENT_PLAN.md`

## Playbook
1. **Your BATNA**: What happens if negotiation fails?
   - Best alternative (litigation outcome from risk report)
   - Walk-away point (minimum acceptable deal)
2. **Their BATNA**: What is opponent's alternative to settling?
   - Their litigation risk
   - Their costs if they don't settle
3. **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)**:
   - Your reservation price (minimum you'd accept)
   - Their reservation price (maximum they'd offer)
   - Overlap = settlement zone
4. **Opening Position**: Where to start (anchoring strategy)
5. **Concession Strategy**: What to give up and when
6. **Talking Points**: 5-7 key arguments for negotiation
7. **Red Lines**: What is absolutely non-negotiable

## Quality Checks
- BATNA must be realistic (based on risk report numbers)
- Concession strategy must have clear limits
- Talking points must be supported by evidence (reference exhibits)
- Include both financial and non-financial terms

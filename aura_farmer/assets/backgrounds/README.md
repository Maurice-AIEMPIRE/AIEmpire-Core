# How to Add Background Videos

1. Find "Satisfying" videos (e.g., Minecraft Parkour, GTA Ramps, Soap Cutting, Hydraulic Press).
2. Ensure they are **vertical (9:16)** if possible, or at least high quality.
3. Save them as `.mp4` files.
4. Drop them into this folder: `aura_farmer/assets/backgrounds/`.

The script will pick a random video from this folder for each new creation.

## 3. The Pinned Tweet (The Manifesto)

**Headline:** "MANUAL WORK IS A CHOICE (AND YOU MADE THE WRONG ONE)."

**Body:**
"I spent the last 3 years building an AI Empire on my local machine.
I have no employees.
I have **5 Autonomous Agents** running my business 24/7.

- They build products.
- They write code.
- They sell for me.

I am not smarter than you.
I just have better systems.

If you want the Blueprint:

1. Follow me.
2. Reply 'SYSTEM'.
3. I'll DM you the files."

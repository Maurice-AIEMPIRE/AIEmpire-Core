Fire Alarm Systems + AI = The Future of Building Safety

16 years in BMA (Brandmeldeanlagen) taught me one thing: documentation kills productivity.
So I built AI agents to handle it.
Now inspection reports that took 3 hours take 30 minutes.
The checklists? Automated.
The compliance tracking? Automated.
This is what happens when domain expertise meets AI.

## 5 Key KPIs

| KPI | Current | Q1 2026 Target | Q4 2026 Target |
|-----|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **AMRR** | EUR 0 | EUR 10K | EUR 100K |
| **Gumroad Sales** | 0 | 50 | 2000 |
| **Fiverr Projects** | 0 | 5 | 100 |
| **Agent Uptime** | — | 99.0% | 99.9% |
| **Security Incidents** | 0 | 0 | 0 |

---

## Target User
**Profile:** Technical founders, SaaS operators, AI consultants, DevOps engineers who want autonomous 24/7 systems without hiring a team.

**Pain:** "I need AI agents to handle ops/content/leads 24/7, but I don't trust cloud services with my data and I can't afford breaches."

**Why Now:**
- Claude 4.5/4.6 makes autonomous agents production-ready
- Ollama makes 95% of operations free (no cloud lock-in)
- Privacy regulations (GDPR, AI Act) favor on-prem solutions
- Open source AI tooling mature enough for production
- Founders burned by ChatGPT outages want redundancy

---

## Anti-Goals (What We Will NOT Do)

1. **No Cloud Lock-In**
   We will NOT build vendor-dependent systems. Ollama (95%), Kimi/Claude (5%) only.

2. **No Public-Facing Services Without VPN**
   We will NOT expose APIs, dashboards, or admin panels to the public internet. Tailscale VPN mandatory.

3. **No Cutting Security Corners for Speed**
   We will NOT skip threat modeling, hardening, or audit trails—even if it slows iteration.

4. **No P3 Data to Cloud Ever**
   We will NOT send legal docs, financials, or restricted data to cloud LLMs. Privacy levels are non-negotiable.

5. **No Overengineering Before Revenue**
   We will NOT build complex abstractions or "future-proof" systems until we hit EUR 10K/month. Ship fast, refactor later.

6. **No Burning Midnight Oil**
   We will NOT sacrifice health, sleep, or sanity for growth. Autonomous systems exist so Maurice doesn't have to work 80-hour weeks.

---

## Strategic Advantage (The Moat)

**16-Year BMA Expertise + AI = Unique Niche**
No one else in the AI consulting space has deep fire alarm system domain knowledge. This creates a defensible wedge into:
- BMA contractors (thousands in EU, each worth EUR 2K-10K/year)
- Legal AI for construction/contractor disputes
- Compliance automation for safety-critical systems

**Offline-First, Privacy-First**
While competitors chase cloud APIs and SaaS margins, we own the "paranoid founder" niche—people who NEED on-prem, auditable, zero-telemetry systems.

---

## Execution Philosophy

1. **Ship V1 in 48 hours, not 2 weeks.**
   Perfect is the enemy of revenue.

2. **Automate relentlessly, but with guardrails.**
   Agents can act, but high-risk actions require manual approval.

3. **Security = Revenue.**
   One breach destroys trust. Zero incidents is the only acceptable target.

4. **Maurice's time is the bottleneck.**
   Every hour saved through automation is an hour for strategy, sales, and growth.

5. **Open source builds trust.**
   Code transparency = customer confidence = premium pricing.

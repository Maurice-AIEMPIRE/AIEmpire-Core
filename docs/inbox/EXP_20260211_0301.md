# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of likes and comments on posts made exactly at 2 AM compared to those posted outside this timeframe (e.g., morning, afternoon).
2. Demographic data about the followers or viewers who engage with these specific timing-posted content.
3. Engagement metrics such as time spent viewing/posting interactions specifically for 2 AM postings versus others.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
1. Select a random sample of posts scheduled at different times throughout one week (including exactly 2 AM).
2. Post identical promotional or informational materials on social media platforms popular among US West Coast engineers.
3. Track engagement metrics like likes, comments and shares specifically for those made right before midnight compared to other time slots.

## METRIC:
- Engagement Rate: The percentage of posts that received at least one interaction (like/comment/share) within the first hour after posting should be higher than 2% in order to assert effectiveness.
- Demographic Match Score: Calculate how closely followers engaging with these specific timing-posted content match US West Coast engineers. An increase over baseline interactions can indicate success.

## DECISION RULE:
If posts made at exactly 2 AM have an engagement rate > 2%, and if the demographic matching score shows a significant rise above standard posting times, then it confirms that "Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

This experimental design prioritizes rapid feedback through real-time social media analytics while focusing on key metrics to validate or refute H2. Adjustments should be made based upon preliminary findings for more targeted future testing.

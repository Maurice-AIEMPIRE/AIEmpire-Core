# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

- **Initial Reach** (baseline): The number of views in initial 24 hours after posting each meme variant on multiple platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Instagram.
  
- **Virality Metrics:** 
    - Total engagement rate: Likes + Comments
    - Shareability score based on retweets/shares/comments received over a week.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Create two sets of memes:
   1a) Meme A with code snippets included in the image.
   2b) Meme B without any additional content (e.g., plain joke or image).
  
2. Post both meme types simultaneously across multiple platforms at similar times and locations to minimize external variability.

3. Track initial reach for each type of post using platform analytics tools within a window period, ideally one day after posting.
   
4. Monitor engagement metrics continuously over 7 days (likes/comments/shares).

---

### METRIC:

- **Virality Index**: Total engagements per meme divided by the number initially posted.

---

### DECISION RULE:
If Meme A's Virality Index is significantly higher than that of Meme B with a confidence level greater than or equal to 80%, then we conclude "Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

```markdown
| Metric                 | Threshold Value |
|------------------------|:----------------:|
| Total Engagements      | > X (to be calculated based on baseline data)   |
| Virality Index         | > Y (determined from experiment results, e.g., 2x for Meme A vs. B) |

If total engagements and virality index of meme with code snippets are greater than those without by at least a factor determined as significant after statistical analysis:
- Then "Memes with code snippets go viral faster."
```

# EXPERIMENT DESIGN

```markdown
1. HYPOTHESIS:
   "How-to" threads receive more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on Stack Overflow.

2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
   - Number of clicks (bookmarks) received by a sample size of 50 random How-to questions and an equal number of Why-to questions within the last month.
   
3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
   Randomly select two groups, one containing randomly chosen 'How-to' posts from Stack Overflow's history for approximately six months period in which they were active (assuming a total dataset that includes millions or tens of thousands such threads), and another with an equal number of random Why-to questions.
   
4. METRIC: 
   The average difference between the mean bookmarks per post divided by how many times each thread was viewed, should be statistically significant enough to assert there's no chance greater than 20% (80% confidence) that this observation is due solely from a sampling variance.

5. DECISION RULE:
    If "How-to" threads are getting significantly more clicks or shares on an average compared with 'Why-to' posts then we can conclude the hypothesis holds, otherwise it does not.

# Experiment Design for Testing H₂ Hypothesis

## Structure:

### 1. HYPOTHESIS
**H₀:** Posting at 2 AM does not capture US West Coast engineers.

**H₁:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers (Contradictory to the null hypothesis, suggesting it's an exploratory rather than confirmatory test).

---

### 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED

- **Posts Content Data:**
  - Number of posts made specifically targeting time slots around and including midnight Eastern Time.
  
- **Engagement Metrics:**
  - Click-through rates (CTR) for these specific targeted post times compared to the rest-of-day periods.

- **Audience Analysis by Location:**
  - Geo-location data or IP address analysis showing engagement from users based in US West Coast time zones specifically during those posts at midnight Eastern Time.

### 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT

**Timeframe:** 
- Conduct over a single day/night cycle (e.g., one full week).

**Post Frequency:**
- Create and post content exclusively around the target times:
    - Every hour from Midnight to Mid-Morning (Eastern time)
    - Noon
    - Afternoon intervals.
  
### 4. METRIC

- **Click-through rate increase:** Target at least a CTR improvement of +5% specifically for midnight Eastern Time posts compared with other targeted periods.

### 5. DECISION RULE: If X, then Y

**If the observed click-through rates (CTR) during Midnight Eastern time period exceed those from non-targeted times by more than 3%, we'll reject H₀ and conclude that posting at this specific hour captures US West Coast engineers with a statistical significance level of α = 0.05.

## Execution Plan:

1. **Post Content:**
   - Generate content tailored to the interests commonly found among engineering communities.
  
2. **Engagement Tracking Tools:** 
   - Utilize Google Analytics or similar tools for precise tracking and analysis on engagement metrics specifically tied with time-zone data analytics (Geo-location services).

3. **Analysis Phase Post-Experiment Execution**:
    - Compare Click-through rates, user interactions by location-time combination.

4. **Decision Making:**
    - Evaluate if the observed CTR increase statistically confirms that posting at 2 AM targets US West Coast engineers more effectively than other times during a typical day/night cycle of one week (7 days).

This experiment can be executed and analyzed quickly within this short timeframe, allowing for rapid hypothesis evaluation while maintaining rigor in measurement. If we achieve an increase above the specified threshold (+5%), it strongly suggests that our original hypothesis has merit.

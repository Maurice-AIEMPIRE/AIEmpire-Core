# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
Memes containing code snippets receive significantly higher engagement (shares, likes) and virality metrics compared to memes without code snippets.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Engagement Metrics:
    - Number of shares per meme post.
    - Average number of comments received by each meme within the first hour after posting.
    - Total views in the initial 24 hours for both types (memes with and without code snippets).
    
- Virality Indicators: 
    - Speed at which memes go viral, measured as time to reach a certain threshold of engagements.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Create two sets of identical meme formats:
1. Set A contains original humorous text-only jokes.
2. Set B modifies the same texts with relevant code snippets integrated into them (using tools like HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

Post both memes on a social media platform simultaneously in similar contexts and times to control for time-of-day effects.

## 4. METRIC
- Primary Metric: Engagement rate per meme post, measured as shares/comments/views.
    - Target Metrics:
        - Meme with code snippet (Set B) should achieve at least **60%** higher engagement compared to Set A within the first hour after posting.
    
## 5. DECISION RULE

If Memes with Code Snippets have an average of X engagements per meme more than Text-only Jokes in the initial one-hour period, then accept H4 as supported.

To achieve a confidence level (e.g., 80%), ensure sufficient sample size by:
- Posting at least **10 memes** for each set simultaneously.
  
### Example Calculation
Assume "Engagement Rate" is calculated using shares/comments/views divided over total posts. If Set A achieves an average engagement rate of Y, then H4 would be supported if Set B's observed engagements are greater than 1.60 * Y per post within the first hour.

This experiment design leverages quick comparisons across two sets while measuring direct interaction metrics to evaluate virality effectively and efficiently.

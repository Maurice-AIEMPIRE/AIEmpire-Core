# Rigorous Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without code snippets.

## Evidence Required:
- **Virality Metrics for Each Meme Type (with and without code):**
  - Number of shares, retweets/likes over time.
  - Growth rate in followers or subscribers attributed to the meme's virality influence on social media platforms like Twitter/Facebook/TikTok/Giphy.
  
- **Audience Engagement Levels:**
  - Comments per post/post interaction for each type.

## Fastest Experiment:
To achieve an 80% confidence level with minimal resources, we could run a controlled A/B test over one week. Split the audience into two groups (Group A and Group B) to receive different meme formats:

- **Group A** receives memes without code snippets.
- **Group B** gets similar content but includes catchy code snippets in an accessible format.

This would provide immediate feedback on virality patterns compared between both sets of posts over a short time frame. The viral nature should be observable through the engagement metrics and spread rate across social media platforms, using existing analytical tools provided by these services for real-time data collection.


## Metric:
The primary metric to monitor is **engagement growth**, which can encompass shares/retweets per post as well as overall follower/subscriber increase attributed directly or indirectly from interaction with memes containing code snippets. An ideal engagement rate would be an observable uptick in the first 24 hours of posting compared between Group A and B.

**Specific Metric:** Increase in average number of retweets/shares within a day (0-1 hour) post-meme release for both groups, aiming to exceed baseline viral metrics by at least X%.


## Decision Rule:
If **Group B's engagement growth rate exceeds that of Group A’s significantly**, then we conclude the hypothesis H4 is supported: Memes with code snippets go viral faster. This threshold (X%) would be defined based on a preliminary analysis comparing current trends in meme virality without specific benchmarks, setting it as an acceptable margin for significant difference.

# Example Implementation:

1. **Audience Segmentation:** Divide your audience into two randomized groups ensuring similar demographic and interest profiles.
2. Deploy memes with identical themes but varying only by the presence of code snippets to Groups A & B respectively over one week through chosen social media platforms (Twitter/Facebook/TikTok/Giphy).
3. Utilize built-in analytics tools on these platforms for real-time engagement data collection, focusing primarily on shares/retweets and comments.
4. Analyze collected metrics at end-of-day intervals comparing Group A vs Group B to identify statistically significant differences in virality patterns using chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate.

**Note:** This design assumes access to social media platform analytics tools for precise measurement of engagement data points required, focusing on real-time observation and comparison capabilities. Further analysis might be needed post-experimentation period depending upon the observed outcomes against expected benchmarks (X%).

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
"H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Conversion rate of aggressive copies compared to polite copies.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
The quickest experiment would involve a split-test (A/B testing) where half the traffic receives an aggressive ad, and the other gets a polititical one. This test could be executed quickly online with minimal setup time for comparison.
  
#### Steps:
1. Create two versions of advertisement content: Aggressive Copy (`Ad_A`) and Polite Copy (`Ad_B`).
2. Randomly assign visitors to see either `Ad_A` or `Ad_B`.
3. Measure conversion rates (e.g., clicks, sign-ups) over a short period.

### METRIC
- Conversion Rate Difference between aggressive copy vs polite copy.
  - Desired metric: Aggressive Copy's CTR > Polite Copy’s CTR by at least 20%.

### DECISION RULE:
If the observed difference in conversion rate is statistically significant with an effect size equal to or greater than 0.2, then we conclude that "Aggressive copies convert better."

**Note:** In practice, achieving a statistical significance level (p-value) of less than 5% would typically be aimed for; however, as per the FASTEST EXPERIMENT criteria above aiming for an 80% confidence threshold.

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure adequate sample size to achieve desired power.
- Conduct tests across different demographics and contexts if possible.

## Hypothesis
**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

### Evidence Required:
1. **Engagement Data for Posts Posted at Different Times (Including Midnight)** - Specifically focused on the engagement rates of posts made around midnight by those targeting US West Coast time zone.
    a) Number of views or clicks within an hour after posting
    b) Response rate, i.e., comments/likes/replies to these specific nighttime postings.

2. **Demographic Data** (if possible and ethical with consent):
   - Geolocation data showing the engagement from users located in US West Coast regions specifically around 2 AM.
   - Time zone information of those engaging or responding positively towards posts made at this time slot

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
    a) Engagement rate comparison between nighttime posting vs daytime/post-midnight (to establish baseline).
    b) Comparison against the company's overall average engagement metrics.

### Fastest Experiment
**Small Test to Get 80% Confidence**

1. Run two distinct sets of posts:
   - Group A: Standard time slot postings, say around peak hours for US West Coast.
   - Group B: Midnight/posted at exactly 2 AM targeting same audience and content as group A.

Both should have a significant volume (at least equivalent to standard engagement) but kept within ethical boundaries concerning spam or unnecessary promotion. This helps in eliminating variances due to different volumes of posts being made.


**Timeframe:** Conduct this experiment over two weeks for consistent data collection, assuming the baseline is established with at least 2 days prior.

### Metric
- **Primary metric: Click-through Rate (CTR)**
    - Group A’s CTR serves as a control.
    - Compare it to Group B's CTR specifically post-midnight engagements. Targeting an increase of over X% in engagement metrics for the hypothesis validation or rejection at this time slot.


**Example Goal:** Achieving 5-10% higher click-through rates on posts made around midnight compared with regular peak hours.

### Decision Rule
If **Group B’s (midnight) CTR > Group A's (peak hour) baseline + X%, then H2 is confirmed.**

Conversely, if there's no significant increase or it falls below the established benchmark of group A by a statistically irrelevant margin (<X%), we would reject Hypothesis 2.

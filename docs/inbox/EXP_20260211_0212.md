## Hypothesis
H3 states that "How-to" threads receive more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on a particular platform.

---

## Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis accurately and confidently (80% confidence level), the following data points are needed:

- Total number of how-to thread pages.
- Number of unique users who have bookmarked each individual page in those How-To categories over a specified time frame, e.g., 30 days or one month. This would provide an understanding if more bookmarks per total page count is true for all such threads combined.

---

## Fastest Experiment
The fastest experiment that can yield the desired confidence level involves collecting data from two sample groups of pages: 'How-to' and 'Why-to'. 

- **Sample Size** (n): 100 how-to posts; a comparable number in why-to categories.
  
Using these samples, we would calculate bookmarks per post for each category. If there's significant evidence that one group has noticeably more clicks than the other with an alpha level of .05 to test our null hypothesis stating there is no difference between groups and observing if H3 holds true.

---

## Metric
The exact metric we're interested in monitoring here will be:

- Click-through-rate (CTR) for bookmarks on 'How-to' threads compared against CTRs for bookmarks that occurred following the creation or updating of 'Why-to' posts. 

We need to ensure this value exceeds 2% as per our specified goal.

---

## Decision Rule
If there's a statistically significant difference in bookmark clicks between How-To and Why-To pages with an alpha level .05, we can confidently state there is evidence that H3 (How-to threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to') holds true. If not, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at this confidence interval.

---

The outlined experiment design would enable us to test whether how-to posts garner significantly higher engagement in terms of bookmarking activity compared against why-to categories on a given platform or community using minimal resources and time needed for research purposes while still maintaining an 80% level of statistical significance.

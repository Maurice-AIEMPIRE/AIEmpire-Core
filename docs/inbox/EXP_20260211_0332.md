# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS

## Hypothesis
H5: DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies.

### Evidence Required:
1. Number of direct messages (DMs) sent containing the phrase "Value First".
2. Total number of responses received from those DMs.
3. Comparison group DM data not using "Value First" for equivalent context and volume to control variables like time, platform usage demographics etc.

### Fastest Experiment
- Select a social media channel/platform that supports direct messaging (DMs) with identifiable metrics on interactions such as Twitter or Facebook Messenger if the hypothesis relates specifically.
- Send an equal number of DMs using "Value First" versus without it over short intervals to keep data fresh and minimize external variables.

### Metric:
1. Average response rate for 'Value First' containing DM vs non-'Value First'.
2. Confirm that there's a statistically significant increase in responses with the metric being 3x greater than or equal to the control group.
   
### Decision Rule:

**If:**

- The average number of replies from DMs using "Value First" is at least three times higher compared to those not containing it.

**Then we can conclude that H5 holds true.**

Note:
A confidence level for 80% with a sample size calculation should be performed before starting the experiment, considering factors such as expected variability in responses and effect sizes needed to detect an increase of 'threefold' or greater.

# Experiment Design for Testing H3

## Hypothesis
H3 states that "How-to" threads receive more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on a given platform.

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis effectively:

- Count the number of bookmark actions (like bookmarking) per post type ('How-to', and 'Why-to') over an identical time frame.
- Identify total views to normalize data, as some threads might receive more visibility leading directly into bookmarks without much context on their usefulness.

### Fastest Experiment:
The fastest experiment would involve a quick snapshot of the two categories during peak hours across different days for at least one week. To reach 80% confidence:

1. Select three diverse high-traffic time periods within that day (morning, midday, and evening).
2. Choose weekdays to cover workdays when user engagement is expected.
3. Randomly select a sample of 'How-to' threads equal in number as the total available 'Why-to'.
4. Collect data from this random selection during those peak hours over one week.

### Metric:
To watch:

- Bookmark count per post type (e.g., Average bookmarks for each category).

---

### Decision Rule: 
If H3 is true, then we should see a statistically significant increase in the bookmark counts of 'How-to' posts compared to 'Why-to'. This can be quantified by setting an 80% confidence level; if more than 80 out of these samples consistently show higher bookmarks for ‘How-to’ threads with less variance inside this sample set (compared to other categories), then we conclude H3 is supported.

### Note:
Statistical tests like the Chi-Square test can be applied here once enough data has been collected. However, due to space and time constraints in proposing an experiment design directly answerable for 80% confidence without actual numbers or more detailed planning of sampling strategy (like dealing with biases), these details are omitted from this brief outline.

Remember that achieving true statistical significance requires careful consideration beyond the scope provided here; factors like sample size relevance, effect sizes observed within those samples compared to theoretical expectations based on known data patterns in social media behaviors would also be critical. Further refinement of sampling methods and confidence level attainment procedures is advised for an actual experimental design aiming at 80% certainty.

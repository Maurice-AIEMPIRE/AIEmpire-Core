# EXPERIMENT DESIGN
**Date**: 20260211_0313

## Hypothesis

H0: DMs with 'Value First' do not get significantly more replies than other messages.

HA: DMs with 'Value First' receive at least three times the number of replies compared to others.


## Evidence Required
1. Number and count of DM responses (replies) for each message that includes "Value First" versus those without.
2. Control variables like time, day, platform used etc., as well as ensuring messages are comparable in terms of length/content aside from having 'Value First' included.

   - Total number of DMs with ValueFirst: X
    Count of replies to these DM's = Y

   - Total Number of non-DM’s without VAlueFirs and their count respectively.
  

## Fastest Experiment:

We can get 80% confidence if we randomly sample at least **500** messages, half containing 'Value First' and the other half not. A sample this size is large enough to make statistically significant conclusions while still being manageable in terms of resources.


For instance,

* Randomly select a total number N=500
    * Divide them into two groups: Group1 with VAlueFirs(250) ,Group2 without ValueFirst (250)

**Metric**

We will use the raw count/replies for each message as our primary metric.

- CTR > 3.0%


**Decision Rule**
If X = Replies to messages containing 'Value First' / Total number of such DMs is greater than or equal to three times Y, then we reject H0 (p-value < α level) and accept HA that VAlueFirst leads to significantly higher replies.

*Note: In this case CTR > 3.0% would mean there are at least 250 more responses compared to the other half of DM's.
**Endnote**

If X is less than thrice Y, then we don't reject H0 (p-value < α level) and accept HA that VAlueFirst does not lead to significantly higher replies.


## Hypothesis Testing 

P = P(X > 3*Y)

where:

- **X:** Number of Responses obtained for DMs with 'Value First'
    
    - X ~ Poisson(λ1)
  
**Y:**

Number of responses observed in the control group (without ValueFirst)

   Y ~ Pois(N*(p2))

Assuming that we have random sampling, both these variables are independent and can be modeled as binomial.

X ~ Binom(n=250,p=p1) 

Y = Binom(n=N-p,n*p(p2))

**Decision Rule**

Reject H0 if P(X > 3*Y ) < α level (e.g., .05 for a confidence interval of about 95%)


## Assumptions
* The DM messages with 'Value First' and without are randomly sampled, independently.

    - Normality assumptions may not be necessary as we’re looking at response counts. Poisson models fit well in these scenarios.
    
* Our sample size is sufficient to observe the expected difference between groups using a binomial test.


## Sample Size
We can calculate exact N for our case by observing historical data first, then adjusting according to observed standard deviations.

**Note: If we’re looking at an online platform with millions of DM's sent every day and we're interested in testing across all those (or even just the top 1% most viewed), it's possible that a sample size as large or larger than N=500 would be needed, depending on our exact goal. We can also use historical data for this purpose.*

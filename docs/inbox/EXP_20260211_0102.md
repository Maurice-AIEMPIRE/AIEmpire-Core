# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS

## Hypothesis:
**H5:** DM messages with 'Value First' receive three times more replies than those without.

---

### 1. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of DMs sent (with and without "Value First" in the subject).
- Count of responses received to each type.
  
For instance, if we send a total of `T` messages:
- Group A: DM with 'Value First' (`A = T/2`)
  - Responses from group A: `R_A`
- Group B (Control): DMs without "Value First" (`B = T/2`)
  - Responses from group B: `R_B`

### 2. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To get an **80% confidence level**, we need to determine the sample size required for a significant difference in responses between groups A and B.

Using power analysis (e.g., Cohen's d formula):
- Assume mean response rates are similar initially.
- Calculate effect sizes needed: Δ = 3x baseline rate of Group B

Let’s assume:
- Baseline average replies per DM without "Value First" (`μ_B`) is `X`
  
Effect size calculation for power analysis (Cohen):

\[ d_{observed} = \frac{Δ}{σ} \]

### Sample Size Calculation
Using standard software tools like G*Power, we input the following:
- Desired Power: 0.80 or 80%
- Alpha level (`α`): typically set at 5% for a two-tailed test.
  
Assuming Cohen's d (effect size) = 1:

Sample per group needed `n_A ≈ n_B`.

### 3. METRIC
Exact number to watch: 

\[ \text{Number of Responses Ratio} (\frac{R_A}{A}) :\] versus \( R_B/A \)

**METRIC:** If the ratio for Group A significantly exceeds three times that expected baseline response rate (μ_B) from group B.

### 4. DECISION RULE
- **Decision Rule X:** Let `d` represent Cohen’s d calculated as described above.
  
    - Decision rule: IF \( |d| > critical\_value \), THEN H5 is supported; otherwise, it isn't significantly different than the baseline responses expected without 'Value First'.

**Critical value for a two-tailed test at 80% power and α=0.05:** ≈ ±1.96 (for large sample sizes).

---

## Experiment Execution:

1. Randomly divide your DM messages into Group A ('Value First') and control group B.
2. Send `T/2` DMs to each participant, ensuring they are randomly assigned for unbiased results.

### Post-experiment Analysis:
- Calculate the mean responses from both groups (`R_A/A`, `R_B/B`).
  
**Hypothesis Testing:**
Use a t-test or ANOVA (depending on sample size and variance) comparing average response rates between A and B:

\[ H0 : μ_A = 3μ_B \]
\[ Ha : μ_A ≠ 3μ_B\]

---

If the observed difference is significantly larger than what would occur by chance, we reject `H0` in favor of our hypothesis.

**Example Conclusion:**
- **Rejecting \( H_0 \): Group A ("Value First") receives responses at a rate more than three times higher compared to group B (without "Value First").**

### Note
Always ensure ethical guidelines for DM experiments are followed, respecting privacy and consent.

## RIGOROUS Experiment Design

### HYPOTHESIS:
**H1:** Posting at midnight captures US West Coast engineers.

---

#### Evidence Required:

To test this hypothesis rigorously and get 80% confidence level results with the smallest possible experiment, we need to collect data on post engagement metrics specifically from posts made exactly at midnight (00:00 AM) Eastern Time. The key datasets required would include:
1. **Post Timing** - Exact time of posting in UTC.
2. **Engagement Metrics**
   a. Number of likes
   b. Number of comments per user/account type/country/region/geolocation, etc.

---

#### Fastest Experiment:

The smallest test possible to get 80% confidence would be:
1. Post once at midnight (00:00 AM) Eastern Time.
2. Track the engagement metrics for this post specifically over a short period (e.g., within an hour after posting).

This ensures minimal data collection while observing immediate user interaction with posts made exactly as hypothesized.

---

#### Metric:

The metric we should watch closely is:
**Engagement Ratio per Post:** Number of comments + likes received divided by the number of US West Coast engineers engaging directly or indirectly (likes, shares) within a specified short timeframe after posting at midnight. This would need to be calculated across multiple test posts for accuracy.

---

#### Decision Rule:

- If **(Comments/Likes Received / Total User Engagement with Midnight Posts)** > 0.02,
   - Then we have evidence supporting the hypothesis that US West Coast engineers are indeed engaging significantly more (80% confidence) than other regions or times.
- Otherwise, 
   - We reject H1 and conclude there's insufficient data to support it.

---

In summary:

The goal is to monitor a single test post's engagement at midnight EST. By analyzing if this metric surpasses the 2% threshold in relation to total US West Coast engineer engagements within an hour of posting (assuming you can identify that region accurately), we would determine H1 validity.

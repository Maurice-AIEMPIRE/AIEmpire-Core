# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. **Time-specific Engagement Data**: The number of likes/shares/comments/posts made by users on a platform when posts are published exactly or around the time window (e.g., midnight, half-past twelve).
   
2. **Demographic Information**: Timezone information and location data to confirm that US West Coast engineers were indeed engaging with these postings.

3. **Engagement Metrics Before 12 AM and After Midnight Postings**:
   - Number of likes/shares/comments/posts on posts made at different times.
  
4. **Comparison Data for Control Group Posts Made During Peak Engagement Hours (e.g., Morning, Afternoon)**: Baseline metrics to understand normal engagement levels.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- Select a popular social media platform frequented by US West Coast engineers such as LinkedIn or Twitter.
- Schedule posts related specifically and broadly appealing topics at 2 AM across the three main time zones on the west coast (PST, PDT).
  
**Duration:** Run for one month to gather enough data points.

---

### METRIC
- **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: Track if there is a statistically significant increase in engagement metrics such as likes/shares/comments/posts at 2 AM compared with other times of day.
    - Goal Metric: CTR > X% where 'X' represents the baseline average for peak hours which could be set initially to benchmark.

---

### DECISION RULE
- **If** posts made specifically around or exactly at midnight (UTC), and targeted towards US West Coast engineers, then:
  - The engagement metrics significantly increase compared with control group times.
  - If CTR is observed greater than X%, conclude that posting time of approximately 2 AM captures the intended audience.

By following this structured approach to designing an experiment for testing whether posts made at around midnight capture a specific target demographic (US West Coast engineers), we can gather concrete evidence, evaluate metrics effectively and make informed decisions.

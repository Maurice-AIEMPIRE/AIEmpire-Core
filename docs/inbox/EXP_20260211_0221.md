# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H0:** DMs with 'Value First' do not get significantly more replies compared to other messages.

**Ha:** DM recipients who see a message containing "Value First" receive 3x the number of responses in comparison to those without it. (i.e., H5)

---

### Evidence Required

- The original dataset must include:
    - All DMs sent over an identified period.
    - Whether each recipient saw a 'Value First' DM or not, which can be determined through metadata analysis if available/easily extractable from the platform's logs/data access capabilities.

  Or alternatively,

  If it's impossible to determine who has seen what:

- A randomized subset of DMs sent over an identified period with varying contents (with and without "Value First").
    - An equal split between those that contain it vs. do not.

### Fastest Experiment

A full-scale experiment would require time-tracking each DM's open/read times to ascertain which recipients actually saw them, followed by a manual or semi-automated analysis of replies received for the entire subset.

An alternative approach is outlined below:

1. Randomly select 100 DMs with varying contents (including both ones that contain "Value First" and those without it).
2. For these selected DM recipients:
    - Track which messages receive responses.
3. Compare average number of responses between 'Value first' vs non-'Value first'.

### Metric

**Metric:** Average Replies per Day for DMs with/without ‘Value-first’ (e.g., CTR) > 1% confidence interval.

---

### Decision Rule
If the mean replies/day observed from those seeing a DM containing "Value First" is at least double that of others, then accept Ha; otherwise reject H0.

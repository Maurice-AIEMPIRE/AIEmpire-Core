# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
"H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

- Number of posts tagged as "how-to" and their respective bookmark counts over a specific period (e.g., one month).
- Number of posts tagged as "why-to" in the same time frame.
  
**Data Points Needed:**
1. Total number of 'How-to' threads posted during specified times with corresponding bookmarks count for each thread.
2. Total number of 'Why-to' threads post within those periods and their bookmark counts.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

The quickest way to gather initial evidence is through an observational study that collects the required data over a short span, such as one week or approximately 7 days during peak usage times (e.g., weekdays from morning till evening). This shorter duration helps quickly accumulate enough posts for analysis but might still provide preliminary insights. For robust results with around 80% confidence:

- Sample size should be at least **200 'How-to' threads and 150 'Why-to' threads**.

## METRIC:
To ensure a statistically significant comparison, monitor the average bookmark count per thread type.
  
- Goal Metric: Average bookmarks for each post category ('How-to', ‘Why-to’).

| Post Type | Minimum Averages to Achieve |
| -----------| ---------------------------|
| How-to     | > 10                        |
| Why-to      | < 5                         |

## DECISION RULE:
If the average number of bookmarks per 'How-to' thread is significantly higher than that for a 'Why-to' post, then we can conclude:

**Decision Rule:**

- If Average Bookmarks('How-to') > X (where X = threshold determined by previous experiments or pilot study) and
  -Average Bookmarks('Why-to') < Y,
  
Then H3 is supported. Otherwise reject the hypothesis.

Where:
X and Y are chosen based on preliminary data insights from a smaller sample set to avoid Type I error while maintaining statistical power (e.g., X could be significantly higher than average bookmarks per 'How-to' posts observed in earlier studies).

Note: The specific values of X, Y should ideally come after observing initial trends. This ensures the experiment is statistically sound and avoids biases.

**Example Decision Rule using hypothetical numbers from pilot study:**  
- If Average Bookmarks('How-to') > 15 (based on historical data) and
  -Average Bookmarks('Why-to') < 5,

Then H3 ("'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.") is confirmed. Otherwise, we do not have sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis based upon observed bookmark counts.

**End of Experiment Design**

This structure ensures that any conclusions drawn are statistically valid and derived from rigorous analysis rather than anecdotal observations or incomplete data.

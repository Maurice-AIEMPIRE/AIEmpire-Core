# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### Evidence Required
1. **Time-Specific Engagement Data**
   - Number of interactions (likes, shares, comments) for posts made specifically around the time zone's equivalent to 2 AM.
   
2. **Demographic Information on Engagers**
   - Location data or IP addresses indicative of US West Coast engineers.

3. **Historical Post Performance Comparison:**
   - Engagement metrics from regular postings versus those posted at 2 AM over a significant period (to establish baseline performance).

---

### Fastest Experiment
1. Select the most active platform(s) for US West Coast engineering communities.
   
2. Create multiple posts with identical content but schedule them to go live around different times across several days/times, including once specifically targeting an equivalent of 2 AM in Pacific Time.

3. Use A/B testing methodology (control group vs experimental time slots).

---

### Metric
**Exact Number:** Engagement rate at the specific post time should be *measured* against other posting intervals to establish a baseline engagement metric that would constitute capturing US West Coast engineers with an **80% confidence level**; typically, this could mean observing if there is more than 2 times engaging activity compared to non-peak hour posts.

---

### Decision Rule
If the post at the equivalent of *X* time-zone has significantly higher (at least by a margin equal or better than our baseline) engagement rate when compared with other slots **and** contains demographic data confirming that engagers are indeed located in US West Coast engineers' areas, then we will conclude H2 is supported.

---

## Notes:
- Ensure the sample size for each posting time slot during testing period (preferably several days to weeks), and control variables such as content quality/format.
- Postings should be uniform across all posts except scheduled times. This controls external factors affecting engagement unrelated specifically to timing, like special promotions or holidays.

**Disclaimer:** The above experiment design is simplified for clarity; real-world experiments may require additional checks (e.g., ensuring privacy regulations are met when collecting location data).

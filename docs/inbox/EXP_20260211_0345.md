# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
H3: "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' threads.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of posts labeled as either "How-to" or "Why-to".
- Count of bookmarks per post.
- Total count and mean number of bookmarks for both types ("How-to" vs. "Why-to").
- Timestamps to check if the time frame is consistent across samples (to control temporal effects).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Sample 200 posts each from 'How-to' threads, ensuring they are randomly selected.
2. Simultaneously sample another set of 200 random and distinct 'Why-to' thread posts.

Ensure sampling happens within a very short time frame to minimize the impact on temporal data variations (e.g., during peak or off-peak hours).

## METRIC
Monitor:
1. Average number of bookmarks per post in both "How-to" threads.
2. Standard deviation for better confidence interval calculations later.

Target metric: 
"The average number of bookmarks per 'How-to' thread is significantly greater than the mean by at least 20% compared to a matched sample size from comparable timestamps."

## DECISION RULE
If:
- The calculated p-value <0.05 (indicating less than a 5% probability that observed difference happened due to chance), then Y: "H3 hypothesis stands accepted with >80% confidence."
Else, reject H3.

Ensure random sampling is representative and free from selection bias.
Also ensure data privacy norms are followed when collecting bookmark counts for public platforms.

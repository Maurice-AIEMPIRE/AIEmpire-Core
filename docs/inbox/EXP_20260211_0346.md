## HYPOTHESIS
H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED 
To test this hypothesis effectively:

1. Number of Bookmarks per Post Type (how-many-bookmarks-howto vs how-many-bookmarks-why)
2. Time period over which data is collected
3. Control variables, such as the thread's age and visibility

We would need to collect a statistically significant number of bookmarks for both "How-to" threads and 'Why-to' posts from similar platforms that have comparable engagement levels.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT 
To get an 80% confidence level with minimal effort:

1. Select two popular websites or forums (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow).
2. Identify a sample of at least ten "How-to" threads and five 'Why-to' posts from each site.
3. Record the number of bookmarks for these samples over one week.

## METRIC
The exact metric to watch would be:

- Bookmarks received by both post types (how-many-bookmarks-howto vs how-many-bookmarks-why).

We aim at an 80% confidence interval, which means we look for a significant difference in the number of bookmarks between "How-to" threads and 'Why-to' posts.

## DECISION RULE
If there is more than twice as many bookmarks on average per post type (e.g., meanBookmarks_howto > X2 * meanBookmarks_why) then conclude that H3 holds true; otherwise, we reject the hypothesis.

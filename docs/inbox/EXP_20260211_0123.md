# Hypothesis Test for Bookmark Count on 'How-to' vs 'Why-to' Threads

1. **HYPOTHESIS**:
   "H3: How-to threads get more bookmarks than Why-to."

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:
   - Number of bookmarks accumulated by a sample set of ‘How-to’ and ‘Why-to’ posts over the same time period.

3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT (Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence)**: 
   Randomly select one 'How-to' thread that has reached at least X total views from within Y hours on DayZ.
   
4. **METRIC**:
   Number of bookmarks received by the selected How-To Thread compared with a Why-Thread.

5. **DECISION RULE (If X, then Y)**: 
   If there is significantly fewer 'Why-to' threads that have reached at least 1% bookmark rate than corresponding ‘How-to’ posts in comparable categories and timeframes on DayZ.

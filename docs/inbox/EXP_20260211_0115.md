# Experiment Design for Testing "Memes with Code Snippets Go Viral Faster"

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** Memes containing code snippets will go viral faster than memes without them.

---

### Evidence Required

To test this hypothesis rigorously:
- **Virality Rate Data Points:**
  - Number of shares (likes, retweets).
  - View counts.
  - Comments and engagement metrics for both meme types over a specified period.
  
- **Demographic Information:** Age group distribution to see if certain demographics engage more with code snippets.

---

### Fastest Experiment

**FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Small Sample Size Test**
1. Create two sets of memes:
   - Set A (Code Snippets): Memes containing programming language syntax or actual small, relevant coding examples.
   - Set B (No Code): Similar meme themes without any code snippets.

2. Launch both types simultaneously on multiple social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit with targeted tags/hashtags to attract similar audiences interested in technology/memes/coding communities.

3. Track initial virality metrics for the first 24 hours across all posts using automated tracking tools (e.g., Google Analytics, platform-specific insights).

---

### Metric

**METRIC:**
- **Virality Rate:** Compare and track total shares/view counts of Set A vs Set B memes.
  
To achieve a statistically significant result with an acceptable margin for error:
  - Virality rate should be measured in terms like increased engagement metrics (e.g., views per hour, likes per minute) to reach at least the threshold where **Set A** significantly outperforms **Set B** by more than standard deviations observed across multiple trials.

---

### Decision Rule

**DECISION RULE: If Set A memes have a statistically significant higher virality rate compared to Set B within 24 hours (with an adjusted significance level, say p < .05), then accept HYPOTHESIS.**

- Use statistical software for t-tests or ANOVA tests on the collected data points.

### Summary

1. **HYPOTHESE:** Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED:**
   - Number of shares, views
   - Comments and engagement metrics (likes/rates)
   - Demographic information for targeted insights
  
3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT:**
   - Create 10 pairs each containing one meme with code snippets vs another without.
   - Simultaneously launch on social media platforms like Twitter & Reddit.

4. **METRIC:** Increase in virality rate (likes/shares per hour) by a significant margin compared to no-code memes within the first day of release, aiming for statistically proven results using appropriate tests and confidence levels (> 80%).

5. **DECISION RULE:**
   - If Set A exhibits significantly higher engagement metrics than set B with p-value < .05; accept HYPOTHESIS.

**Note:** Continuous refinement based on initial findings can further solidify the hypothesis, leading to more extensive trials or adjustments in meme content and distribution strategy for viral success.

# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "Memes with code snippets go viral faster"

## HYPOTHESIS
"Creating memes that incorporate short and relevant code snippets results in a higher virality rate compared to standard text-only or image-based meme formats."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED

To test this hypothesis, we need data points on:
1. The original content of the created memes (text only vs. incorporating codes).
2. Engagement metrics such as shares, likes, comments.
3. Time taken from creation until peak virality is achieved.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A small-scale A/B testing approach across social media platforms to collect real-time data on meme engagement can quickly demonstrate the impact of code snippets inclusion versus standard memes without extensive waiting periods for viral spread analysis due by using a sample size that yields 80% confidence in statistical significance. To achieve this, we would need at least:

- Two sets with an equal number (e.g., N=200) but different meme formats.
- A platform and time window conducive to rapid sharing behavior.

## METRIC

The primary metric will be the virality rate defined as follows:
"Virality Rate = Total Shares + Likes + Comments / Number of Memes Created."

We would look for a significant difference in Virality Rates between memes with code snippets (Group B) versus standard meme formats without them (Control Group A).

Additionally, we may also monitor engagement metrics separately to discern which elements contribute most significantly.

## DECISION RULE

"If the mean virality rate of memes including code is greater than that of control group by 80% confidence level and p-value less than significance threshold (e.g., alpha = 0.05), then it supports our hypothesis."

A t-test can be employed to assess this difference statistically, assuming we have a normally distributed dataset or sufficient sample size due to the Central Limit Theorem.

To increase accuracy further:
- Time until peak virality should also show faster spread for meme with codes.
- Engagement metrics' variation across different platforms will offer insights into platform-specific behaviors.

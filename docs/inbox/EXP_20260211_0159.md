# EXPERIMENT DESIGN
**Date**: 20260211_0159

```markdown
1. **HYPOTHESIS**:
   H3: "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on Reddit.

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:
   - Number of comments per post (categorized as How-To or Why-).
   - Total number of likes for each comment.
   - Whether the original thread received any direct bookmark links in its description/initial content from users upon posting, not just subsequent bookmarks by viewers after reading.

3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT**:
   Set up an automated scraping tool to collect data on a sample set (e.g., 1000) of 'How-to' and 'Why-' posts created within the last month across different Reddit subreddits that are known for such discussions.
   
4. **METRIC**:
   Number of direct bookmarks linked at time of posting versus subsequent user-generated bookmark links divided by total number of comments as a proportion, with an expected increase in this metric (proportion) being greater than 0% or any positive value indicating more initial bookmarking.

5. **DECISION RULE**: If the average first-time bookmarked posts per 'How-to' post are significantly higher compared to subsequent bookmark counts for equivalent sets from ‘Why-’ threads, then H3 is supported.

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis H2

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Engagement Metrics per Post**
  - Number of likes, comments, shares.
  
- **Demographic Data (if available)**
  - Location data for active users engaging with the posts made specifically around 2 AM Eastern Time on weekends and weekdays to see if there's a significant spike from US West Coast engineers.

---

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
**Experiment Setup:**

1. Select one specific social media platform popular among tech professionals (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).
  
2. Create high-quality posts that are likely of interest for this demographic.
   
3. Schedule these posts to go live at exactly **12 AM and 2 AM Eastern Time**, across a consistent time span over multiple days.

4. Repeat the posting process consistently until you accumulate enough data points (at least one week).

---

## 4. METRIC
**Engagement Rate:** Monitor engagement metrics such as likes, comments per post specifically posted at 2 AM.
  
- Target Metric: Engagement rate should significantly increase compared to posts made during other times of day.

Example Goal:
```
> CTR > X% (where "X%" is a chosen threshold that denotes significant interest).
```

---

## 5. DECISION RULE
**If:** The engagement metrics from the post scheduled at **2 AM Eastern Time are statistically significantly higher than those posted earlier or later in the day, then:**

- Postulate H2 as supported (therefore "Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers").
  
```
IF Engagement Rate of posts made exactly @12 AM and 2 AM > X% more 
THEN Hypothesis H2 is Supported.
ELSE Continue Testing with adjusted parameters or conclude hypothesis needs revision/rejection if not met consistently across multiple trials.

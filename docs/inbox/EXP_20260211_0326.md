# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies.

---

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis rigorously:
1. **Number of Responses (N):**
   - Total number of responses received for each DM without the "Value First" tag.
2. **Response Rate:**
   - Number and percentage rate of DMs with 'Value First' getting at least one reply.

---

## Fastest Experiment
A small-scale test to get 80% confidence involves sending out a controlled sample size:

1. Send an equal number (e.g., n=30) of both untagged messages ("without Value First") and tagged ones ('with "Value First"').
2. Ensure the content remains identical for fair comparison.

---

## Metric
**Metric:** Average reply rate.
- Without 'Value First': Calculate CTR = Number of Replies / Total Messages Sent (n).
- With 'Value First': Calculate CTR = Number of Replies with tag / Total Tagged Messages Sent (m).

We aim to observe that the response rates are significantly different. Ideally, an untagged DM's replies should be 1/3rd compared to those tagged.

---

## Decision Rule
**DECISION RULE:** 
- If average reply rate for 'Value First' DMs is at least three times higher than non-tagged ones (CTR > X%), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude our test. Here, let’s say X = 1/3.
  
Specifically:
- **Null Hypothesis H0**: The response rates are not significantly different or less in proportion to tagged vs untagged messages.

This structured approach ensures an efficient experiment that can provide significant insights within a minimal timeframe while achieving high confidence levels.

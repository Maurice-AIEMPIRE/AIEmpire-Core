# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Conversion rates (e.g., click-through rate - CTR) from both aggressive and polite copies of the same product or service.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Set up A/B testing for a sample size that statistically represents an increase in conversion with overconfidence level:

- Create two versions: one using aggressive copy ("Buy Now at 20% Off!") vs. another employing mild persuasion (polite).
- Ensure both groups are exposed to the same audience and context.
  
To achieve faster results, initially run this test for a short duration but enough times that we can reliably observe trends before scaling up.

## METRIC:
Focus on achieving an increase of 20% in conversion rates from polite copy as compared with aggressive copy. In other words:

- Aggressive Copy CTR = X%
- Polite Copy CTR should equal or exceed (X + ((0.2 * X)))%

## DECISION RULE: 
If the observed difference between A/B tests exceeds a minimum threshold of 20% improvement for conversion rates, then we conclude aggressive copy is statistically superior.

The experiment must also control variables that could influence results such as timing and audience characteristics to ensure validity.

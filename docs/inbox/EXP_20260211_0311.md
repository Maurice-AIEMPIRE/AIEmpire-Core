# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS "H5"

## Hypothesis
**H0:** DMs with 'Value First' get the same number of replies as those without it.

**H1 (Alternative):** DMs with 'Value First' receive 3x more replies compared to ones that don't have this phrase included in their text body.

## Evidence Required

To test our hypothesis, we will need data points on:

- The total count of messages received by each DM.
- Whether or not the message includes "Value First" (boolean attribute).
- Number of responses/calls/emails/replies for those DMs.

We should also track demographic information like age and gender to rule out biases if needed.

## Fastest Experiment

To achieve 80% confidence in our results, we can perform a quick test using the following steps:

1. Randomly select two equal-sized groups of similar demographics from existing DM contacts.
2. Send an identical message (including "Value First" for group A and omitting it entirely for group B) to each person within both groups at roughly 11:00 PM local time on Day X, ensuring all other variables remain constant between the test conditions.

## Metric

The metric we will monitor closely is:

- The average number of replies received by DMs containing "Value First" compared to those without it.
  
For this experiment alone we're interested in achieving a statistically significant difference (e.g., at least 3x more) with an acceptable level of confidence. 

---

## Decision Rule

Our decision rule for the hypothesis test will be as follows:

- If H1 is true, we should observe that DMs containing "Value First" receive on average three times or significantly fewer responses compared to those without it.
  
The experiment would ideally continue until achieving 80% confidence in our results. We can calculate this using a sample size calculator with specified parameters (e.g., desired power of the test), but for brevity, we'll consider that we've reached an adequate level after completing one run as described above.

Note: A follow-up detailed analysis should be performed on gathered data to validate hypothesis and conclusions drawn from it. If results are inconclusive or too weak statistically significant findings aren't achieved in our initial quick experiment's attempt (described here), we can continue with a larger sample size until desired confidence is reached, following standard statistical practices.

Note: This outlined experiment design presupposes the availability of DM contacts data and consent for running such an A/B testing campaign. In real-world scenarios it would be crucial to ensure compliance with privacy laws and guidelines as well as ethical considerations when handling sensitive communications like DMs.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of backlinks (bookmarks) on a sample set of How-To and Why-To posts over the same time period.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Select two random groups representing blog post categories:
    - Group A: Randomly chosen 50 "How-to" threads.
    - Group B: Randomly chosen 50 “Why-to” threads posted during similar periods of high traffic and activity to control for external variables such as time-of-day or seasonality.

2. Record the number of bookmarks received by each post within a week after publication, accounting only for internal backlinks (bookmarks made from posts on the same platform).

3. Repeat this process over multiple weeks with varying conditions if initial data doesn't show statistically significant results to achieve 80% confidence level in outcomes between two groups.

## METRIC
- Average bookmarks per How-To post versus Why-To post.
  
**Example Metric:** On average, How-to threads receive a minimum of X+2 bookmarks compared to the Y bookmarks received by 'Why-to' posts over one week (X and Y represent observed averages).

## DECISION RULE: If an H-test or T-test conducted on collected data shows that the mean number of backlinks for "How-to" is significantly higher than “Why-to” with a p-value < 0.05, then we can conclude there are more bookmarks in How-To threads (Y).

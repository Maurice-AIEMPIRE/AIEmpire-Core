# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Conversion rates (CR) of both aggressive and polite copies over a specified period.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest test to get 80% confidence.
To obtain an 80% confidence level, we can use the Wilson score interval for binomial proportions. The smallest sample size needed will depend on expected CR values:

- Let's assume:
  - Conservative estimated conversion rate (polite copy) = p1 = 2%
  - Expected higher converted click-through-rate due to aggressive nature assumed: 
    - Targeted increase by 20%, thus, new conservative estimate for the test is q1 = 3% or a slight variation depending on market knowledge.
  
Using an online sample size calculator:
- N (sample size) ≈ ~3000 visitors per group

**Split Testing Design:** Each visitor to our website will see either aggressive copy OR polite copy. 

## METRIC: Exact number to watch
We need conversion rates for both groups.

1. **Aggressive Copy Conversion Rate (\(CR_A\)):**
   - Number of conversions divided by the total clicks (conversions/total visitors).
2. **Polite Copy Conversion Rate (\(CR_P\)):**

**Target metric:** 
- Aggressive copy should show at least 20% higher conversion rate than polite copy.
\[ CR_A \geq CR_P + 0.20 * CR_P = CR_P*(1+20%)\, or (2*CR_P)\]

## DECISION RULE: If X, then Y
**X:** The observed aggressive copy's conversion rates (\(CR_A\)) are significantly higher than polite copy’s average rate.

**Y:** Conclusively accept H1 and decide to adopt the Aggressive Copy strategy.
  
If CR_A < 2 * \(CR_P + \epsilon)\), where epsilon represents confidence interval margin (~0.05 for conservative approximation) - reject hypothesis or fail-safe testing continues as part of iterative improvement process.


### Example Scenario:
- Suppose after running experiments on approximately equal sample sizes (3000 visitors each):

**Results:**

1. **Aggressive Copy Conversion Rate (\(CR_A\)):**
    \( CR_A = 6% \)
2. **Polite Copy Conversion Rate (\(CR_P):**
    \( CR_P = 4,8 %)

In this case:
\[ (CR_A)/(CR_P) > (2*1 + epsilon)\]
Thus concluding H1 holds.

**Decision to adopt aggressive copy strategy across campaigns if results consistently meet the expected criteria.**

# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
Memes containing embedded or accompanying code snippets will achieve higher virality rates compared to memes without such content.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Virality Metrics**:
  - Total shares (number of times a meme is shared)
  - Reach (total number of people who view the original post and all its subsequent reposts/shares, up to three levels deep)

- **Content Comparison Data Points:**
  - Presence or absence of code snippets in memes
  - Demographic information about viewers (age range, gender distribution) as a control variable

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Creating two sets of meme templates:
1. Set A with common coding language examples embedded within the image.
2. Set B without any codes.

Both sets should be distributed over social media platforms known for quick viral sharing (like Twitter, Reddit).

- **Distribution Plan:**
  - Randomly distribute memes to a large sample size initially across diverse groups on these networks using targeted ads or bot accounts that mimic human behavior as closely as possible.
  
## 4. METRIC
To achieve an 80% confidence level for virality:
- Total shares (sum of original, first-level share, and second-level sharing) must be tracked.

**Target:**
Total Shares > X value where the threshold surpasses initial baseline viral content without code snippets by at least a statistically significant margin. For instance:

If average non-code snippet meme has 500 total shares as an observed mean (µ), we can expect memes with codes to have significantly higher means, say µ + Δ = 600+ range based on preliminary observations.

## 5. DECISION RULE
**Rule:** If the Total Shares for Set A are statistically greater than those in Set B by a margin exceeding standard deviation over multiple trials (~20%), then conclude that H4 holds true (i.e., memes with code snippets go viral faster).

### Statistical Test Methodology:
- Perform T-tests comparing virality metrics between meme sets.
- Confidence Interval checks to determine if there is an 80% confidence level difference in total shares.

By following this rigorous experimental design, we can objectively test the hypothesis and validate whether embedding codes within memes contributes significantly toward their viral spread.

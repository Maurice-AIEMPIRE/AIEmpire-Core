# Experiment Design for Testing "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster"

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** Memes containing code snippets share will receive more engagement and spread virally compared to memes without code.

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points:
1. Number of shares for each meme (with or without a snippet).
2. Total likes received by each meme.
3. Time taken from posting until reaching peak views/shares/likes on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit.
4. Type classification: memes with code vs. those without.

## Fastest Experiment
**FASTEST EXPERIMENT:** Create 100 pairs of similar content, where one half contains a relevant meme (with text explaining the snippet) while others contain plain explanation or no comparison at all on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit for consistent audience reach.
- Divide randomly into Control Group A: Plain memes without code snippets.
- Experimental Group B1-B10: Memes with related coding language, programming concepts in a non-code format (e.g., images of variables/functions).
  
Run the experiment over 7 days. Monitor social media shares/clicks daily.

## Metric
**METRIC:** Average rate of increase per day compared to Control group for each meme type.
- Aim: Experimental memes should show at least double viral growth in comparison with Plain Memes (Control Group A).

## Decision Rule:
If the average number of increases is 20% more than control on experimental platform, then it proves H4.

## Example
For instance,
* MEME X shares increase by 25%.
- Control group memes: +5%
- Experimental meme containing code snippet shows viral behavior as per expectation.

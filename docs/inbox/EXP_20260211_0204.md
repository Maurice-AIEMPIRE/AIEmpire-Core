# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
H0 (Null Hypothesis): DMs with 'Value First' do not get significantly more replies compared to those without it.

Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): DM messages that include "Value First" receive three times as many responses on average than similar-looking ones which don't contain this phrase.
 
## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To test the hypothesis, we need two sets of DMs: one with 'Value First' and another without it.

* **Control Group:** A collection of DM messages that do not include "Value First."
* **Experimental Group:** The same number (N) of randomly selected DMs from a different set which contain the phrase “Value First”.

We need to record:
1. Number of replies each message receives.
2. Total time sent and received for all control group vs experimental group messages.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Smallest test: We select N=50 DM pairs (e.g., one with "Value First" & another without it as a matched pair).

To achieve an acceptable level of confidence, we need at least:
- A sample size that can show us the difference clearly in response rate.
 
## 4. METRIC
We will look for replies per message received to quantify success.

* **Target Metric:** The experimental group with "Value First" should receive more than three times as many responses compared to each control pair without it (Experimentally Observed vs Expected).

**90% confidence interval:**

- Control Group Average Replies = 1
- Experimental Group Target Responses per message = >3

## 5. DECISION RULE
If the average number of replies for DMs with "Value First" is statistically significantly higher than that without it, then we can conclude Ha (alternative hypothesis) holds true.

We will use statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in response rates between these two groups.

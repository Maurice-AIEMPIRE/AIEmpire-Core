# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis rigorously:

- A/B testing results from two versions of an ad (aggressive vs. polite).
- Conversion rates for each version over a defined period.
- Sample sizes to ensure statistical significance and power analysis.

## Fastest Experiment

1. **Set up the experiment:**
   - Run 10,000 impressions per variant with equal traffic distribution initially if conversion rate difference is unknown or use prior knowledge of expected differences in sample size estimation (using tools like G*Power for Power Analysis).

2. **Monitor results closely and run until statistical significance (>95% confidence level) is reached at an alpha = 0.05:

    - Ensure minimum power to detect a significant effect with pre-determined minimal detectable difference.

3. If necessary, iterate experiment by incrementally increasing impressions or sample size for more accurate measurement once initial trends are observed (e.g., double the number of samples).

## Metric
The key metric is **conversion rate** improvement:

- Calculate and compare conversion rates between aggressive copy (`C_a`) vs polite copy (`C_p`).
- Check if `C_a = C_p + 20%`.

If after reaching statistical significance, we observe an average increase in the conversion of up to approximately 21%, it supports H1.

## Decision Rule
The decision rule will be based on a confidence interval for difference between proportions:

**Decision Rule: If (confidence interval around `C_a - C_p`) includes or exceeds +20% at p < 0.05, then accept **H1; otherwise reject the hypothesis.**

This experimental design ensures that it is rigorous in testing whether aggressive copy significantly converts better than polite by a margin of greater than 20%. The fast experiment setup maximizes efficiency while ensuring statistical significance.

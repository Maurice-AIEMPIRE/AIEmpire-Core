# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'."

**H0 (Null Hypothesis):**
"There is no significant difference in the number of bookmarks between How-to and Why-to posts."

**HA (Alternative Hypothesis):**
"How-to posts receive significantly more bookmarks compared to Why-to posts."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To test this hypothesis, we need data on:
1. The total count of 'How-to' threads.
2. The total number of bookmarks received by all the How-to threads combined over a specified period (e.g., 6 months).
3. The same information for Why-to posts: Total Count and Combined Bookmarks.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
**Timeframe:** 
We will collect data from popular online forums or communities where both 'How-to' and 'Why-to' are commonly posted over a span of one month (30 days).

### Steps:
1. Identify at least 100 distinct How-to threads.
2. Count the bookmarks received by each thread within this period, then sum up to get total bookmarks for all identified Threads in category A ("How-to").
3. Repeat steps #1 and #2 independently but with Why-to posts (category B).
4. Ensure that both categories are comparable regarding activity levels.

## METRIC
- Total Bookmarks received by How-to threads.
- Total Bookmarks received by Why-to threads.
  
**Target Metric for 80% Confidence:** We aim to achieve an Average Click-through Rate (CTR) higher than a specified threshold, say **1.5 times the average CTR of 'Why-to' posts**, which can be translated into bookmark counts.

## DECISION RULE
- If Total Bookmarks received by How-to threads > X * (Total Number of Why-to Threads),
  where X = Target Metric multiplier (> 1 for our case).

**Example Decision Rule:**
If the total number of bookmarks on 'How-to' posts is greater than **150% more bookmarks per post compared to 'Why-to'**, we will reject H0 and accept HA.

# Conclusion

The experiment should be conducted over a short, but sufficient period (e.g., 1 month) for gathering enough data points. By comparing the total bookmark counts between how many threads are in each category under comparable conditions within this timeframe while maintaining an accurate count of individual bookmarks received by posts on both categories will yield our targeted metric to test and confirm whether How-to or Why-to receives more engagement measured through bookmarking rates.

**Note:** Adjustments can be made based upon the results, data collection tools (such as web scraping with Python), ensuring consistent measurement across different threads for unbiased comparison.

# Rigorous Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of shares on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter)
2. Total engagement metrics including likes, comments and retweets.
3. Time taken from initial post to reaching a significant threshold in views/engagements.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Create two sets of memes with similar themes but different characteristics:
- Set A: Memes without code snippets (control group).
- Set B: Memes that include short, understandable and relevant code snippets.
Both meme types should have the same design elements to minimize bias. 

Track these posts for a period ranging from 24 hours up to one week.

### METRIC
Observe whether memes with code go viral faster by measuring:
1. Time-to-viral threshold (e.g., time taken until at least X shares, Y likes/comments/retweets).

For confidence of the results: Aim to achieve an engagement rate higher than a predetermined baseline for control group posts as quickly as possible.

Example metric target would be reaching 5x more views compared to average meme performance within one week with code snippets included.
 
### DECISION RULE
If memes in Set B (with code) reach twice or thrice the viral threshold of memetic set A (without code), then Y = "Hypothesis H4 is confirmed."

The experiment design should also ensure that external factors affecting virality like time-zone, day-of-the-week etc. are controlled for to avoid bias.

This rigorous test will provide a strong evidence base about if memes with short and understandable snippets of codes go viral faster than others without them.

Note: Further experiments can be conducted by varying the length/complexity/code snippet included in meme B posts but starting from this baseline experiment design would suffice as an initial testing hypothesis.

# Hypothesis Testing Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS:
How-to threads get more bookmarks than Why-to.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of How-to Threads created over a specific period (e.g., one month).
2. Number of Why-to Threads created during the same time frame.
3. Total number of unique users visiting these how-to and why-to sections per thread type within that timeframe, to track engagement levels.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

- Set up two identical virtual environments representing How-to (H) and Why-to areas on a popular user-generated content platform like Reddit or Stack Overflow.
  
  - Launch both H and W threads with similar initial conditions: topics related but distinct in nature—How-tos for solving problems, why-tos asking reasons behind phenomena.

- Track the number of bookmarks added to each thread type daily over one week (7 days).

### METRIC:

Bookmark Count per Thread Type

* Target Metric Goal*: For H threads, bookmark count > 150% * average W bookmark rate by day-end.
* Example: If on Day X, an How-to post averages x number of bookmarks and a Why-to gets y; the goal is for every subsequent day's total in H to be greater than (1.5) * daily Y.

---

### DECISION RULE:

If Average Bookmark Count per Hour > 150% Target Benchmark,

Then Hypothesis "How-tos are bookmarked more frequently."

*Example*: If after Day X, an average of y bookmarks have been collected by a Why-to post in one hour and how-to threads receive at least (1.5 * x) the number within that same timeframe daily on subsequent days.

**Note:** The above experiment design assumes access to user-generated content platforms for How-tos vs. why-tos; real-world constraints may necessitate adjustments, such as platform choice or thread selection criteria.


The smallest test would ideally be conducted in a controlled environment like Reddit's Sandbox with active participants (at least 100 unique users). To achieve an 80% confidence level quickly across varied demographics and time zones without biasing results due to external factors—ensuring the sample size is adequate for meaningful conclusions. The number of threads, user engagement levels required per session would be established through preliminary pilot testing.

Data collection should focus on direct bookmarking actions by users as well as indirect measures like 'favorites' or similar functionalities provided within platforms (e.g., Reddit's flair badges). Analyzing this collected data against the predetermined metric will confirm if How-tos indeed receive a higher bookmark frequency than Why-tos, validating our hypothesis.

To ensure robust results and minimize bias from external variables such as time of day posting occurs would involve randomizing post times across different days/times throughout extended periods. Tracking engagement metrics (views/readership) per thread type alongside bookmarking behaviors will further strengthen the experiment's validity.


The above design provides a comprehensive approach to testing our hypothesis on how-to vs why-tos bookmark behavior, using real-time data collection methods and analysis tools suited for web content platforms with active user participation.

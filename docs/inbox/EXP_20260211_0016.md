# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

---

### Evidence Required:
- Number of posts made specifically aimed to target this demographic (US West Coast).
- Engagement metrics such as clicks, likes/dislikes on these targeted postings.
- User profiles or geographical data indicating whether the users engaged with are from the desired region.

### Fastest Experiment
1. Select a social media platform popular among US West Coast engineers and create 100 posts targeting them at different times throughout one week (including precisely two AM sessions).
2. Use geo-targeting tools to specifically aim these postings towards California, Oregon, Washington D.C., etc.
3. Track engagement metrics such as clicks on the links provided in each post.

### Metric
- CTR (Click-through Rate) from targeted posts at 10:00 PM - 11:59 PM vs Targeted Posts made between 2 AM and March 2 AM

### Decision Rule:
If X = Click-Through Rates (CTR > 5%) for the postings specifically posted during both time intervals, then Y = Hypothesis is valid.

In conclusion:

1. **HYPOTHESIS**: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.
2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Number of targeted posts and engagement metrics like clicks/likes/dislikes from these regions (US West Coast).
3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT**:
   - Create social media postings aimed specifically towards the desired demographic throughout one week, including precise 10 PM to AM timeslots.
4. **METRIC**: Click-through rates for posts at night vs morning targeting US West Coast engineers
5. **DECISION RULE**: If click through rate (CTR) > 80% then Hypothesis is valid.

### Example Data Table:

| Time of Day | Number of Posts | Target Region               | Total Views | Engaged Users |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Night        | X                | US West Coast engineers     | Y            | Z              |

In conclusion, the proposed experiment is designed to test whether targeted social media posts aimed at a specific demographic are more likely captured during particular times of day. The data collected from this experimentation can provide further insights into optimal posting hours for target audiences and help improve marketing strategies.

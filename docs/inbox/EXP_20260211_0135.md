# RIGOROUS Experiment Design for H3 Hypothesis Testing

## **1. Hypothesis**

**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

## **2. Evidence Required**
We need to collect data on the number of times a post in both "How-to" and "Why-to" categories receives at least one bookmark within 24 hours after being posted.

- Number of posts classified as either How-to or Why-to threads.
- The time each thread was created (T).
- The date-time stamp when any bookmarks are received on the respective topics, which we'll call T_bk for 'How-to' and T_wt for 'Why-to'.
  
## **3. Fastest Experiment**

The fastest test to get 80% confidence would involve monitoring an equal number of new posts in both categories over a short period (e.g., one week), recording the bookmarks received within this time frame.

- Select n=50 how-to and y=n=50 why-to topics.
  
## **4. Metric**
Calculate bookmark CTR for each post type by dividing total bookmarks/bookmarks per thread:

For 'How-To':
CTR_H = Total Bookmarks / Threads Posted
  
For 'Why-To': 
CTR_W = Total Bookmarks / Threads Posted

A difference in the Click-Through Rate (CTR) between how-to and why-to threads would imply a significant disparity.

## **5. Decision Rule**

Decide that if CTR_H > 1.25 * CTR_W, then we can conclude with high confidence (>80%) 'How-To' posts get more bookmarks than 'Why-To'. If not disproved at the same level of significance (p-value < .20), it would also suggest a difference between both categories.

**Note:** We are assuming here that only one bookmark per post is counted towards total bookmarks received, and other factors like engagement or quality don't influence bookmarking. Additionally, we consider 1.25 as an arbitrary multiplier to determine statistical relevance; this value can be adjusted based on the sample size n after performing a pilot test.

**Note:** We should also randomize our choice of posts for monitoring both categories (how-to/why) with regard to time and any other variables such as day-of-the-week, etc., that might influence bookmarking behavior.

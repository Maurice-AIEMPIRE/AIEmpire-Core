# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS "H5"

## Hypothesis
**Hypothesis:** DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies.

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis rigorously and confidently:

1. **Number of Replies (Response Rate):**
   - The total number of responses received by the DM containing ‘Value First’.
   
2. **Control Group Data:**
   - Number of DMs without 'Value First'.
   - Total replies to these control group DMs.
  
3. **Time Frame:** 
    - Time period during which both types (with and without) are sent.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Sentiment analysis scores for the messages containing ‘Value First’ versus those that don’t, if applicable.


## Fastest Experiment
To achieve 80% confidence with a small sample size:

- Send out an equal number of DMs (let's say N=20) using 'Value First' in each DM and another set of N=10 without it.
  
**Note:** Increase the sample sizes incrementally to confirm results.

## Metric

We need precisely two key metrics:
1. Average Number of Replies per DM with ‘Value First’.
2. Average Number of Replies per DM Without ‘Value First’.

The metric we are focusing on will be:

- **Ratio (R):**
  - \( R = \frac{\text{Average Responses for 'Value First'}}{\text{Average Responses without 'Value First'}}\)

We aim to confirm if the value is at least three times higher.

## Decision Rule
Our decision rule, based upon achieving an 80% confidence level:

- **If** (R > 3) then we conclude "H5: DMs with ‘Value First’ get three times more replies."
  
- If R ≈ 1 to less than or equal to approximately 2.8 (> but not including ≥), no conclusion can be made based on this sample.
  
- Additionally, if our p-value < 0.05 for a statistical significance test (such as Chi-Squared Test) indicating an independent variable's effect.

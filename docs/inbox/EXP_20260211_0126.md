## HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
We need the following data points to test this hypothesis:
- Number of clicks generated by aggressive copies (A_clicks)
- Total number of impressions for each set of aggressive and polished copies used in ad campaign A(A_impressions) and B(B_impressions), respectively.
- The conversion rate from polite copy, which is CR_polite = (B_conversions/B_B_impressions).
  
## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To get 80% confidence as fast as possible:
1. Create a small-scale test using the aggressive versus polished copies with equal impressions and conversions to establish baseline data.
2. Increase total number of impressions by an order-of-magnitude factor, maintaining similar conversion rates for accurate comparisons.

## METRIC
The exact metric we should watch is Aggressive CTR = A_clicks / A_impressions compared against Polite CTR (B_conversions/B_B_impressions).

*Note: The 20% difference in the hypothesis must be translated into a measurable improvement of this CTR.*

## DECISION RULE

If "Aggressive copy converts better than polite" by at least X%, then Y, where:
X = Desired increase to reflect that aggressive copies convert significantly (e.g., if CR_polite is observed as 1% or less in preliminary testing)
Y = Decision rule: Increase use of Aggressive Copy A. Decrease Polite Copy B usage.

*Note for decision-making on X and whether Y should be increased, decreased or held constant based upon the findings.*

# Notes

- The metric we will watch is an improvement from polite copy's CTR.
- If it takes too long to get 80% confidence levels with this method (which may not always happen), consider changing your test until you can achieve that.

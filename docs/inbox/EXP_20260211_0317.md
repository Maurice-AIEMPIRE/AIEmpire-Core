# Hypothesis Testing for Meme Virality with Code Snippets

## 1. HYPOTHESIS:
Memes containing code snippets spread faster on social media platforms than memes without code.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

- Number of shares and likes per meme
- Time taken to reach a certain number of engagements (shares, comments)
- Demographic data about the audience engaging with each type of meme

**Data Points Needed:**

1. Total engagement count for both types of memes.
2. Initial posting time versus peak sharing times.
3. Audience demographics and interests.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

Create two sets (A & B) containing an equal number of similar-themed, popular internet culture-related meme posts—one set with a code snippet embedded within the image/context of each post; another without any included codes—and track their performance over time across various social media platforms.

## 4. METRIC: 

- A significant increase in shares (e.g., average +50% more engagements than baseline for memes containing snippets).
  
**Specific Target:** Average CTR (Click Through Rate) per meme is greater by at least 20 percentage points when compared to the control group without code-snippets.

## 5. DECISION RULE:

- If an observed increase in engagement rate, shares or comments on posts with embedded codes exceeds a predefined benchmark (> +50%), then we accept that memes containing snippets are more likely viral than those not including them.
- Conversely, if there's no significant difference between the two meme types' performance metrics (shares and likes), conclude there is insufficient evidence to support H4.

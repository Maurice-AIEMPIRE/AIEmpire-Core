# Rigorous Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

## Evidence Required
We need the following data points:
- The conversion rate (percentage of users who took a desired action) for aggressive copies vs. polite copies, across multiple versions and samples.
- Sample size to ensure statistical significance at 80% confidence level or higher.

## Fastest Experiment

**Test Size:** At least n = 30 responses per sample group if assuming binomial distribution with moderate success (e.g., CTR of ~10%).

### Steps:
1. Select a total minimum of N=60 users, divided equally into two groups.
2. Present Group A with aggressive copy and Group B with polite copy for the same product/service/offer in different contexts but ensuring minimal variation between samples.

## Metric
**CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
Monitor specifically: 
```markdown
Aggressive Copy CTR > 10% (>Polite Copy's assumed baseline)
```
To achieve a difference of at least +20%, we assume an initial polite copy rate around ~5%.

### Decision Rule:
If the aggressive copy’s conversion rate is greater than twice that of politeness, then aggressively worded text leads to better conversions (i.e., Aggressive CTR > Polite CTR * 2).

## Conclusion
Conduct a statistically significant A/B test comparing both versions across different platforms and contexts for rigorous results.

# Note: Adapt experiment design based on real-world constraints such as time, resources available.

# Hypothesis Testing Experiment for DM Campaigns

## HYPOTHESIS:
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of DMs sent (n) - Total messages containing the phrase "Value First."
2. Replies received per message type.
3. Group A: Messages without "Value First" label, measuring baseline response rate (\( R_A \)).
4. Group B: Messages with "Value First" label.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Randomly select a sample size (n) sufficient to reach 80% confidence level for the difference in reply rates between Groups A and B.
2. Divide selected n messages into two groups:
   - Control group without 'Value First' (\( R_A \)).
   - Experimental group with 'Value First'.
3. Send out DMs according to this division.

## METRIC:

- Calculate both \( R_A = (total replies in control) / total emails sent in the control group\).
- Calculate \( R_B = (total replies in experimental) / total messages labeled as "Value First" \).

The key metric is:
\[ Ratio: R_B/R_A > 3 \]
i.e., Experimental group's rate should be over three times higher than Control's.

## DECISION RULE:

If the calculated ratio from our experiment (\( R_B/R_A \)) exceeds 2 (indicating more replies), accept HYPOTHESIS.
Otherwise, reject HYPOTHESIS and conclude no significant increase in response with "Value First".

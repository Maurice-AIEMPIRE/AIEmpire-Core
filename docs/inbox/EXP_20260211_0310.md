# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without code snippets.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of shares (likes/comments) on social media platforms within 24 hours after posting the meme.
2. Engagement rate measured as likes, comments per share ratio for both types of posts over a period equivalent to their natural lifecycle (~48-72 hours).
3. Total reach in terms of unique viewers/readers before and during peak viral activity.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Create two groups:
1. Group A: Memes with code snippets.
2. Group B: Mememes without code snippets but similar context/content-wise as a control group to eliminate content-related bias.

Post these memes simultaneously across various social media platforms ensuring equal exposure and visibility (same time, same day of the week) for both meme types over 48-72 hours period until they naturally go viral or hit peak engagement. 

## METRIC
Engagement rate measured through likes/comments per share ratio within a specified timeframe (~24 to 48 hours after posting).

Alternatively:
Total shares reached by each type.

Or, if measuring total reach in unique viewers/readers: Total count of individuals who viewed the meme up until its viral phase or peak engagement period. 

## DECISION RULE
If memes with code snippets have at least X% higher average likes/comments per share ratio than those without within 24 to 48 hours after posting (depending on which metric is used), then conclude that H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

Note:
- The confidence level of around 80% can be achieved by statistically significant results in the chosen metrics over a sufficiently large sample size. 
- If possible, it may also help to run multiple trials at different times and on various social media platforms for generalizability.

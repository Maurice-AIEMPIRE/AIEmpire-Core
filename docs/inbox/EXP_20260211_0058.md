## Hypothesis

**H1:** Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

---

### Evidence Required:

- Conversion rates of aggressive copies versus polite copies over a specified period (e.g., days or weeks).
  
### Fastest Experiment:
 
To test this hypothesis with the smallest possible sample size to achieve an 80% confidence level, we could run A/B testing for both versions. Ideally using platforms like Google AdWords where conversion tracking is straightforward.

For aggressive vs polite copy:

1. Create two ads: one uses a more direct approach (aggressive), and another employs softer language with courtesy.
2. Run these campaigns simultaneously on similar traffic sources to ensure comparability, adjusting only the text for variation between versions A and B while keeping other variables constant as much as possible.

### Metric:
 
- The primary metric will be conversion rate improvement percentage from polite copy (B) compared to aggressive copy (A). We aim at observing an increase of 20% or more in conversions with Aggressive Copy over Polite Copy.
  
**Target:** Conversion Rate Improvement ≥ 20%

---

### Decision Rule:

If the observed difference between A and B is equal to or greater than 20%, we will conclude that aggressive copy converts better. If not, then polite copies might perform as well.

Example Calculation:
- Let's assume a conversion rate of X% for Polite Copy.
- We expect Aggressive Copy's conversions = (X + ((0.2 * X) / baseline))

Where "baseline" is the observed initial performance from which we are measuring improvement (+20%).

---

**Note:** Baseline should be determined before conducting A/B tests to ensure comparability between aggressive and polite copy versions.

### Statistical Considerations:

- Perform statistical significance testing (e.g., Chi-squared test) on conversion rates collected.
  
For instance, if baseline Polite Copy Conversion Rate = X%, then Aggressive Copy must show a minimum increase of Y% over Baseline for the hypothesis to hold true. This would be calculated as follows:
Y = 1 + ((20/100)) * (X)

---

### Additional Considerations:

- Track not only conversion rates but also additional KPIs like engagement metrics, bounce rate differences between groups.

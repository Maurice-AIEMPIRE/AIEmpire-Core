## Hypothesis
**H1:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### Evidence Required:
- Number of clicks from the target demographic (US West Coast) on posts made specifically around midnight Eastern Time.
- Click-through rate for these posts compared to those posted outside this window, adjusted by time zones and user location data if available. 

**Data Points Needed:**
1. User engagement metrics including click counts broken down into hourly segments of a 24-hour period with an emphasis at Midnight (Eastern Standard Time) vs other hours.
2. Location metadata for users engaging to determine the geographical spread — specifically focusing on US West Coast engineers.

### Fastest Experiment
**Experiment Design:**
1. Select two time slots in Eastern Time Zone:
   - Slot A: 11 PM EST – midnight EST, as a control (midnight post window).
   - Slot B: Midnight EST.
2. Post identical content at both times over the course of one week to ensure adequate sample sizes while controlling for other variables.

**Fastest Test Duration:** One Week

### Metric
- **Click-through rate per hour broken down by location data and time slot (Slot A vs Slot B)** compared specifically on US West Coast engineers' engagement metrics.
  - For instance, a metric could be: `CTR at midnight EST for users from California > X%`.

**Target Number:** CTR at Midnight Eastern Standard Time significantly higher than during other hours.

---

### Decision Rule
- **If the click-through rate (CTR) of posts made specifically around midnight in Eastern time zone is statistically significant and notably greater compared to similar slots within a 24-hour period, then H1: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.**

**Statistical Confidence Required:** Achieve an 80% confidence interval.

### Additional Considerations
- Utilize A/B testing methodology.
- Ensure random assignment of posts for control and experimental conditions to mitigate bias or confounding variables (e.g., day-of-week effects).
  
Ensure the test includes sufficient sample sizes across different days, times zones with equivalent traffic volumes while isolating US West Coast engineer population metrics. Monitor engagement rates continuously throughout the experiment duration.

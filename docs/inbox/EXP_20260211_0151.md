# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Engagement metrics of posts made during different times (including a control group with no specific timing).
- Demographic data confirming that users engaging are indeed from the US West Coast.
- Time-stamped interaction logs showing when and where interactions occur, particularly around 2 AM on the East coast time zone.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Create two groups of posts:
   - Group A: Posts scheduled to go live at various times (including a control group with no specific timing).
   - Group B: One post exclusively timed for posting during US West Coast's peak night hours, specifically 2 AM.
   
2. Run this experiment over one week.

3. Collect engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares from both groups daily and categorize them by time of day/posting hour (including the control group).

4. Compare results between Group A’s varied posting times vs. a single post timed at peak night hours for US West Coast engineers in terms of engagements specifically coming after 2 AM on East coast.

## METRIC
- Engagement rate per region compared to total posts engagement.
  
Specifically, we need the:
1. Total number and type (likes, shares/comments) of interactions each day from both Group A's varied times and Group B’s peak time post for US West Coast engineers specifically after 2 AM East coast.

## DECISION RULE
- If engagements per Region > X% compared to control group or other varying posting timings AND engagement rate at specified hour (2 AM on the east-coast) is significantly higher than others, then Y: The hypothesis that "Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers" holds true.
  
Alternatively:
If no significant increase in engagements from posts timed specifically for peak night hours compared to varied times or control group exists. Then N/A: Hypothesis does not hold.

Note on X% - depends upon previous engagement trends and baseline data collected beforehand, this needs a preliminary study as well before designing the experiment above.

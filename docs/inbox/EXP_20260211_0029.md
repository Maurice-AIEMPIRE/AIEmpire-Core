# Experiment Design for Testing H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

## Hypothesis
Memes containing code snippets achieve a significantly higher virality rate compared to memes without code snippets when shared on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. (H4)

## Evidence Required

1. Number of shares or retweets/views.
2. Time taken for the meme to reach 1000 views/retweets/shares after being posted.

### Fastest Experiment
A time-limited, comparative study where we post similar memes with code snippets vs without on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter and Reddit) over a short period of one week or less depending upon achieving sufficient sample size for statistical significance. We aim to achieve at least 80% confidence in our results.

### Metric
Time taken by the meme containing code snippet(s) compared to memes with no codes/snippets, until reaching exactly **1000 views/retweets/shares** post being shared on social media platforms (Twitter and Reddit).

## Decision Rule

If a meme with code snippets achieves 1000 shares in less than X hours/days/weeks while the same content without any coding goes viral slower after similar time periods compared to memes, we can conclude that H4 holds true.

Note: The value of "X" would be determined based on preliminary data analysis prior running this experiment.

# Experiment Design for Testing Viral Potential of Memes with Code Snippets

## Hypothesis
- H1: Memes that contain code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis effectively and gather the necessary data points, we need to collect information on two main variables from online meme platforms:

1. **Engagement Metrics** (E)
   - Views/Impressions
   - Shares/Reposts Count

2. **Content Type Indicators**
   - Presence of Code Snippets in Memes (`CS` = 1 if present; `CS` = 0 otherwise)

### Fastest Experiment:
- Create a controlled set, such as two meme templates (one with code snippets and one without) that are visually identical except for the presence/absence of CS.
  
#### Small Test to Get 80% Confidence
To achieve an 80% confidence level quickly:

1. **Sample Size**: Randomly select at least `n = 500` memes per group using a quick social media scraping tool or API (e.g., Twitter's Search API).
2. Track and measure engagement metrics for each meme over the first week post-publication.

### Metric:
- Monitor both groups of memes closely, with particular emphasis on **Shares/Reposts Count**.
  
#### Decision Rule: 
If we have a sample size `n = 500` per group (which is statistically significant to achieve an approximately normal distribution by Central Limit Theorem), then apply the following rule:

- If `Mean(Shares_Reposts_with_CS) > Mean(Shares_Reposts_without_CS)` with statistical significance (`p < 0.05`) and effect size calculated via Cohen's d, we conclude H1 is supported.

### Steps to Follow:
1. Randomly select an equal number of memes without code snippets (n=500).
2. Ensure they are matched for content type but differ in presence/absence of CS.
3. Do the same with another set that contains 500 memes featuring code snippets and matches visually otherwise on platforms like Reddit, Twitter or any other social media platform where meme sharing is prevalent.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. Create two identical versions (A & B) for each template: one containing a simple snippet of code (`CS = 1`) in the image.
2. Post them randomly to different accounts across these selected groups on chosen platforms, ensuring they have similar starting conditions and exposure times as much possible.

#### Monitoring Period:
- Track engagement metrics such as shares/reposts over first week (7 days).

### Data Analysis Method
Utilize a statistical test like **Independent Samples T-Test** or an ANOVA to compare the mean of Shares/Reposts between groups for each meme template type. If significant differences are found, we can conclude that memes with code snippets have higher engagement.

#### Example Decision Rule:
- IF `T-test p-value < 0.05`, THEN H1 is supported (`Memes with CS > Memes without CS`).

In conclusion this experiment design should be able to provide a robust and quick test for the hypothesis, using readily available social media tools to gather relevant data effectively while maintaining statistical rigor.

### Notes
- Ensure meme templates remain consistent across different platforms.
- Factor in potential confounders like time of posting or platform-specific behaviors that may affect engagement. Adjust accordingly if required during experiment execution phase.

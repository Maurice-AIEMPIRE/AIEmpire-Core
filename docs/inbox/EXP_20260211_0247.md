# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
- "H3: How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on a popular online forum."

---

### Evidence Required:

1. **Bookmark Count Data**: The number of times each post is bookmarked by users.
2. **Post Type Classification**: Identification and categorization into two groups - 'How-to' (instructional) vs 'Why-to' (explaining reasons).
3. **Time Frame for Collection**:
    - Duration to collect the data should be long enough that seasonal or time-based fluctuations in user activity are averaged out.
4. **Sample Size of Posts per Category**: Number of posts collected from both categories.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

- To get 80% confidence, we must consider a minimum sample size using power analysis for the chosen metric (bookmark count difference). A preliminary study or pilot survey can help to estimate variance and set this up quickly.
    - **Sample Size Calculation**: Using standard deviations from an initial small dataset collected over one week.

---

### METRIC:

- The number of bookmarks per post type within a specified period. We will look for:
  - Mean Bookmark Count (How-to vs Why-to) \> Threshold
  - Standard deviation to ensure consistent variance between groups.
  
The metric would be: "Difference in average bookmark counts" with the target being significant enough (> X% difference from each other).

---

### DECISION RULE:

- **If** there is a statistically significant positive mean difference (i.e., How-to threads have significantly more bookmarks) on our sample, then
  - **Then we conclude that H3 holds true.**

Statistical significance can be assessed using t-tests or ANOVA depending upon the variance observed in pilot studies.

---

Example Decision Rule:

- If Mean(Bookmarks for 'How-to' Posts) > (Mean(Bookmarks for 'Why-to' Posts)) + Margin of Error AND P-value < 0.05, then we conclude H3 is valid.
  
### Summary Table
| Metric                   | Threshold/Target |
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Mean Bookmark Count     | Difference & Significance Level (< X%)   |

This outline serves as a blueprint for designing an experiment to test the hypothesis regarding bookmark counts in different post types. Adjustments may be necessary based on pilot data and variance observed initially.

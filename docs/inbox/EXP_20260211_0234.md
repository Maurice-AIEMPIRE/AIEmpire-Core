# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H3: "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' threads.

## Evidence Required 
To test this hypothesis we need the following data points:

1. The number of clicks each thread receives (indicating its popularity).
2. If a clicked link results in bookmarking.
3. Classification labels for links as either 'how-tos' or 'why-tos'.
4. Total bookmarks collected by all threads.

## Fastest Experiment
The fastest experiment to get an 80% confidence level would require collecting data from existing users browsing our site and then performing the analysis on this sample of web traffic in real time, instead of waiting for a significant number of new links/events to occur naturally over weeks or months. This way we can start seeing results almost instantly.

## Metric
The metric that needs monitoring is:
1. The difference between bookmarks collected by "How-to" and "Why-to".
2. Click-through rate (CTR) on each thread type, with a target of at least 5% for both types.
3. Total number of clicks per link divided into categories.

## Decision Rule
If the observed bookmark count is significantly larger than expected under null hypothesis H0: Bookmark counts are independent from how-to and why-to labels; then we reject this null hypothesis in favor of alternative Hypothesis HA : "How-tos" get more bookmarks. If not, it suggests that there isn't a significant difference.

We can use the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test to determine if there's statistically significantly different bookmark counts for 'how-tos' vs 'why-to's links.
    
# Conclusion
In conclusion we have clearly defined an experiment by stating its hypothesis and evidence required. We also set up how fast it needs to run (real-time analysis) and what metrics need monitoring, as well a decision rule on when we'll reject the null-hypothesis.

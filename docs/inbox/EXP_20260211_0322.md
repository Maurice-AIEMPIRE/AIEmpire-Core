# Experimental Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' threads.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this hypothesis rigorously we need the following data points collected over a sufficient period of time to ensure statistical significance and mitigate any anomalies or biases. The required evidence includes: 

- Number of views for both How-to (A) and Why-to (B) posts.
- Total number of bookmarks acquired by each post within these threads in their first 24 hours after posting.

We would ideally collect this data over a significant period to account for variability across different days, weeks or seasons. Ideally we want at least one year’s worth of continuous monthly collection until our results have reached statistical significance and beyond so that the trend can be confirmed reliably (note: larger sample size = better reliability).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

### Smallest Test:
We could run this test for 1 day with a minimum dataset including all posts in both A and B thread categories. This would provide sufficient data to check if any statistically significant difference is already apparent at the smallest time frame.

*Note*: If results show no statistical significance within one day's timeframe, then we'll need more days of testing until we can achieve an 80% confidence level (see next section).

### Sample Size: 
As mentioned earlier ideally our sample size would be a few months' worth. With this amount of data collected continuously for each day and averaged over the month we'd have enough to reliably test if there is any statistically significant difference in bookmark acquisition rates between How-to vs Why-to posts.

## METRIC:

The number we want to watch (or metric) here will obviously be total bookmarks acquired within 24 hours after posting. Our exact target could change depending on what kind of confidence level we're looking for at the end, but we'll start with an aim that there should *not* exist a statistically significant difference between A and B threads in bookmark acquisition rates.

## DECISION RULE:

If X: Bookmark counts per post do not significantly differ from each other (p-value > 0.05) then Y: H3 is true; i.e., How-to posts get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' ones, statistically speaking.


*Note*: If the p-value < 0.05 and it turns out to be a significant difference between A vs B threads in bookmark acquisition rates this would lead us into rejecting our null hypothesis that there isn't any statistical significance existing here.

If we have found no differences over one day then we'd want enough days of testing until we've achieved an overall test with p-value < 0.05 and thus able to reject the null-hypothesis (i.e., H3 is true, How-to posts get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' ones).


## Notes:
*Note*: We would ideally run this experiment over a year or longer depending on whether there are seasonal variations in user activity that we want captured. If not found after 1 month we'd have enough data to test for significance and hopefully be able confirm H3 statistically.

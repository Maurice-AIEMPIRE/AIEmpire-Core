# Experimental Design for Hypothesis "How-to" Threads Get More Bookmarks Than 'Why-to'

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3 states that how-to threads receive more bookmarks than why-to posts.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of bookmarks on a set number (N) of randomly chosen how-to and why-to thread titles within the same category.
2. The time period during which these bookmark counts are recorded to ensure uniformity across both types.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
To achieve 80% confidence with minimal resources, select N = 50 for each type - thus having a total sample size of 100 (N=25 how-to threads + N=25 why-to posts). Record the number of bookmarks received by these randomly selected titles over one week.

## METRIC:

We will compare average bookmark counts per thread. The metric is: 
- Average Bookmark Count Per How-To Thread
- Average Bookmark Count Per Why-To Post

If significantly different, we can conclude a preference for how-to threads in terms of bookmarking behavior (with an 80% confidence interval).

## DECISION RULE:
* If the difference between the average bookmark counts per thread type is statistically significant with less than or equal to +/-2 standard deviations from each other at p<0.05 level, then we can conclude that one category receives more bookmarks.

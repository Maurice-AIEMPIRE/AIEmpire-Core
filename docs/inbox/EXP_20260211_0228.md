# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

This hypothesis posits that users who read "How-to" posts are likely to bookmark them at a higher rate compared with those reading "Why-to".

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this, we need the following data points:
1. Total number of reads for both How-to and Why-to threads.
2. Number of bookmarks generated by readers within 24 hours after viewing either type of thread.

---

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT: 

Smallest possible experiment to achieve an estimated margin of error with a confidence level (CI) that approximates achieving at least CI=80% would involve:
1. Collecting initial data from two groups for the first week.
2. A total sample size of 200 posts per category should suffice.

---

## METRIC:

The primary metric we are interested in is bookmarks as follows: 
- Average Bookmark Rate (ABR) = Number of Bookmarks / Total Reads
We aim to compare ABRs between How-to and Why-to threads, looking for significant differences:
- Target Difference > 20%

---

## DECISION RULE:

If the difference in average bookmark rates (> 20%) is observed with an estimated margin error that provides at least a CI=80%, then we accept H3 as supported by our data.

This experiment design ensures all essential factors are considered, focusing on obtaining actionable insights efficiently and accurately while maintaining statistical rigor.

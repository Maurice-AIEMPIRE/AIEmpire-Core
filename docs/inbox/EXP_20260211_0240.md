# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. **Number of Shares** - Tracks how many times a meme is shared on social media platforms within the first 24 hours after being posted.

2. **Time to Go Viral (TGV)** - Measures the time taken for each type of meme (with and without code snippets) to reach at least X,000 shares/tweets/followers across all major social networks simultaneously or in a majority consensus.

3. Engagement Metrics such as likes/comments on posts featuring memes with vs. those without code snippet within 24 hours after posting.


### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Create two sets of meme templates: one set containing simple images/videos, and the other consisting of similar content but embedded with relevant short snippets/code that add value to them (e.g., a quick tip/hack related directly to what is being shown in memes). Make sure both types are visually identical for accurate testing. Post these across multiple social media platforms using different accounts at staggered times.


**Sample post timing distribution:**
- 12 PM - Set A Meme
- 1 PM - Set B (Code snippet) Meme

Monitor and record the time it takes before memes from each set hit a pre-determined viral threshold, say X shares across all channels.

---

### METRIC:
The number of times meme posts with code snippets achieve TGV compared to those without in less than Y hours on average.


**Decision Rule Example:**

- If Set B (with Code Snippets) shows an increase by at least Z% faster time-to-go-viral, then we accept that memes containing relevant short-code/hack/snippet go viral 80%-or-more times faster as compared to the regular set.

---

### DECISION RULE:
If TGV of meme sets with code snippets is X hours less than those without within a sample size N across Y different social media platforms AND both have an equal or high engagement rate, then we conclude that memes containing relevant short-code/hack/snippet go viral 80%-or-more times faster compared to regular set.

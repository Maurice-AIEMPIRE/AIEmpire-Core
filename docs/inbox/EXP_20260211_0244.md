# Rigorous Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H1:** Posting at peak working hours captures US West Coast engineers.

### Evidence Required:
- **Engagement Data Points Needed**
  - Time stamps of when posts are made (to verify they fall within the desired time window).
  - Engagement metrics for each post, such as likes and comments.
  - Location data to confirm that engagements come from users in the Western US region/city.

### Fastest Experiment
- **Small Test with High Confidence**
  - Post content at different times across a full day (12 AM - 11 PM) over multiple days/wk+1 periods. Choose hours during typical working hours for engineers on the West Coast.
  - Track and compare engagements by hour of post.

### Metric:
- Exact number to watch: **Average Engagement Rate per Hour** > X%.
  
  For instance, if previous data shows a baseline engagement rate is around 2%, setting an objective metric might be aiming at achieving more than this benchmark with targeted posts during peak hours (e.g., Average Eng. Rate in target time window = 3%).

### Decision Rule:
- If **Engagement metrics significantly increase compared to non-targeted times** (> X% from baseline), then conclude that posting specifically around the designated working hour captures US West Coast engineers.

## Example Calculation for Metric

Suppose you have collected engagement data over a week. Here is an example calculation:

1. Baseline Engagement Rate (average across 24 hours): **2.0%**
2. Targeted Time Window: Postings at peak working hour identified as high-engagement time.
3. Average Engagement during Peak Hour post for one day = X%.
4. Test Metric Threshold to Achieve >80% Confidence Level on increase in engagement rate.

Example:
- Day 1 - Baseline Engagement Rate across all hours (12 AM – 11 PM) averaged at **2.0%**.
- Targeted peak hour posting recorded an average of **3.5%**, significantly above the baseline during targeted time window, indicating success if this increase persists in subsequent days as well.

```markdown
Decision Rule:
If Average Engagement Rate per Hour (during target times) > Baseline + X%, then conclude that posts at 2 AM capture US West Coast engineers.

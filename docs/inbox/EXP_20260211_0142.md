# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H5"

## HYPOTHESIS
- DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies compared to those without it.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of DM responses (both received and replied) containing the phrase 'Value First'.
2. Total number of such DMs sent.
3. Control group: Count of similar DMs not including 'Value First', both in terms of sending them, receiving replies from others as well.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- Send 300 DM's with a single variation (150 using "Value First" and the other half without it). Ensure equal visibility for all sent messages to avoid any bias due to time or day.
  
## METRIC:
- The response rate per message containing 'Value First' vs. those that don't contain this phrase, expressed as follows: Average Replies/DM ('Value First') / Average Responses DM (No ValueFirst) = 3x

## DECISION RULE
- If the average replies per DM with "Value First" are three times higher than without it then we accept H5.
  
# Note:

This is a simplified approach. In real world experiments, other factors need to be considered like varying type of DMs sent (not only 'Replying', but also original ones), different target audiences etc.

Other metrics such as engagement rate can provide additional insight into the effectiveness of using "Value First". The faster you get responses and replies after DM's have been received it means people are quickly reading them. If this is not an important factor, then perhaps a time-based experiment could be employed (e.g., sending messages at different times throughout the day or week). 

In any event though it's crucial to avoid biases in selecting recipients of DMs as well - for example if DM's were sent only during weekends they would have less responses than those that are spread across weekdays. A simple way around this is by ensuring an even distribution over time (for instance, sending 10 messages every hour etc.). Similarly ensure equal visibility among all participants receiving the message.

Moreover it's important to check whether there was a pre-existing difference between two groups of people before they received DM's; if so it could affect responses. For example one group may be already more active online than another (even though this is not our intention) and thus would produce higher engagement metrics regardless - even without using "Value First". 

Finally it's also crucial to ensure that the experiment doesn't cause harm for participants in any way such as exposing them unnecessarily or violating privacy concerns. All these factors should ideally be considered when designing a rigorous test.

# Note:

It's important not only what we measure but how accurately and consistently can this measurement done (considering various sources of error). Other metrics like engagement rate, sentiment analysis etc., could also prove useful in evaluating the effectiveness of using "Value First". Also it's worth considering whether there are any potential confounding factors that might affect results. For instance if people who use 'Value first' tend to receive more replies simply because they're already active on social media (not necessarily due to them including a specific phrase).

Furthermore, while this design seeks an 80% confidence level it should be remembered even with such high probability there's still chance of error and false positives - especially when multiple comparisons are involved. This is why it's always best practice not only conducting one experiment but replicating the findings across various datasets/data points to ensure consistency in results.

Finally, before running this or any kind of social media campaign for that matter, it would be wise to do a pilot test with 10-20% subset (randomly chosen) and observe its impact. This will allow identifying potential pitfalls beforehand without risking too much on the main experiment.

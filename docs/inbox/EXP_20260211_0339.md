# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Time-stamped engagement data of posts (posts made specifically around the times close to midnight Pacific Time)
- Number and location demographics of users engaging with these posts, focusing on whether they are located in or represent interests from the US West Coast

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest test to get 80% confidence.
1. **Preparation**:
   - Select a single popular social media platform (e.g., Twitter) known for engineering communities such as Dev.to and LinkedIn groups.

2. **Posting Setup**:
   - Prepare multiple posts similar in content, tone, hashtags used previously by US West Coast engineers to ensure they are appealing.
   
3. **Implementation of Posting Schedule**: 
   - Over a 24-hour period (from PMT-11 hours till PMT+1 hour), post identical messages at three different times:
     * T0: Peak engagement time on the platform
     * T1: General mid-day/early evening peak window.
     * T2: Specific posts scheduled for around midnight Pacific Time.

4. **Data Collection** (for 24 hours):
   - Record number of likes, comments and shares at each posting instance 
   
5. **Post-analysis Data Points Required to Support H2**:
   a) User engagement metrics broken down by time zone.
   b) Demographic data showing the geographical location/region interest demographics for engaged users (use platform analytics tools that provide insights on user regions).

### METRIC
- A substantial and statistically significant increase in engagements from US West Coast engineers during T2 compared to other times. 

For example:
- Average engagement rate at peak time = X%
- Engagement rates specifically around 2 AM Pacific Time, as a proportion of the total posts made.
  
A metric could be established like: CTR (Click-through Rate) > 5%, where 'clicks' are defined by significant interactions such as likes or shares. 

### DECISION RULE
If engagements at midnight PMT substantially increase compared to other times (greater than baseline engagement rates + a margin of error for random variation), then "H2 holds true" indicating that posting around this time captures US West Coast engineers.

**Note:** This is an idealized and small-scale experiment. Real-world conditions may introduce variables requiring adjustments or more extensive data collection efforts.

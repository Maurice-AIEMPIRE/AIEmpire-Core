# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than those without.

## Evidence Required
- Number of responses to direct messages (DMs) containing the phrase "Value First" compared to similar but non-motivational content.
  
## Fastest Experiment 
To achieve 80% confidence, we need a statistically significant sample size. Assuming an effect size where 'three times more replies' means threefold increase in response rate:
- Collect data from at least **300 DMs** with the phrase "Value First" and compare it against another set of similar messages without this motivational trigger.
  
## Metric
Monitor specifically for the average number of responses received per message. We need to track if one group receives 3 times more replies than another.

- **Metric:** Average Replies Per Message (RPM) 
  - Target: RPM with 'Value First' > 2 * RPM without

## Decision Rule
If DMs containing "Value First" receive an average of twice the number of responses compared to non-motivational messages, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that incorporating a motivational trigger like "Value First" significantly increases replies.

**Decision rule:**
- If Average RPM (with 'Value First') > 2 * Average RPM (without), then HYPOTHESIS is supported.
  
## Sample Size Calculation
Using preliminary data or assumptions, we can calculate the required sample size for an accurate test with at least a **90% confidence level and less than ±5% margin of error**.

Assuming:
- Baseline response rate without 'Value First' = X%
  - We want to detect threefold increase (3X).
  
Using standard formulas or software, we derive the necessary sample size for our test. In practice:

Sample Size formula: 
\[ n = \frac{Z^2 * p(1-p)} {E^2} \]

Where:
- \( Z \) is 1.96 (for a two-tailed confidence level of approximately 95%),
- \( p \) represents the assumed baseline response rate,
- and E stands for margin of error.

For simplicity, if preliminary data estimates X as ~5%, then expected RPM increase to target would be around **15%.**

## Execution Plan
1. Randomly select DM groups containing "Value First" (n=300).
2. Select a similar group without motivational trigger content.
3. Track responses over one week for both datasets.

**Outcome:**
- Compare the average number of replies between two sets using statistical analysis like t-tests or ANOVA to confirm if our hypothesis is statistically significant at an 80% confidence level (or better).

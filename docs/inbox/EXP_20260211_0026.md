# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of views (visits) each thread receives over a given time period.
2. The number of times these "How-to" and "Why-to" posts are bookmarked by users.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- Select 10 representative 'How-to' threads across various categories on Reddit for the first week after they were posted (to ensure freshness).
- Concurrently select another set consisting of 10 equivalent length, quality "Why-to" counterparts that have received a similar amount of initial attention but are different in nature from each other.
  
---

### METRIC:
- **Bookmark Ratio**: The average number of bookmarks per thread divided by the total views for 'How-to' threads versus those same metrics calculated separately for 'Why-to'.
  - Target Metric Example (for H3): "Average bookmark ratio > X% higher in How-to posts compared to Why-to".

---

### DECISION RULE:
- If **bookmark ratios** are statistically significantly greater than zero when comparing the average values of bookmarks per view between ‘How-to’ and “Why-to” threads, then accept that 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks.

Note: Statistical significance could be assessed using an appropriate statistical test such as a t-test if bookmark counts approximate normality or non-parametric tests otherwise. If X% increase in the average number of bookmarks per view for "How-to" compared to “Why-to” is statistically significant, H3 would support that 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than ‘Why-to’.

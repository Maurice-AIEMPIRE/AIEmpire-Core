# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

---

## Evidence Required:
1. Number of clicks (indicating interest) for each thread type ('How-to', 'Why-to').
2. Total number of bookmark actions on both types.
3. Thread engagement metrics such as views, replies/answers/comments.

---

## Fastest Experiment
Conduct an A/B test by splitting the audience randomly into two groups over a period with one group seeing "How-to" threads and another seeing "Why-to". Collect data for 1 week to get statistically significant results quickly (given sufficient sample size).

**Sample Size:** Minimum of ~500 participants split evenly across both thread types, assuming an average engagement rate.

---

## Metric
Number of bookmarks per total number of clicks. We need a consistent metric like:

- **CTR > 2%**

This would mean that for every hundred views or interactions ('Why-to' vs 'How-to'), the "How-to" threads are getting more than two bookmark actions, indicating higher interest.

---

## Decision Rule
If bookmarks per click ratio (bookmark/click) of ‘How-to’ is significantly greater (> X%) compared to “Why-to”, then H3 holds true. For instance:

- If 'How-to' > 2% and 'Why-to' < 1%, we can confidently conclude that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks.

---

## Notes
* Randomize the participants into control (views) vs treatment groups.
* Monitor for at least one week to collect enough data points, adjusting sample size as necessary. 
* Control variables such as time of day and demographics if they are deemed influential factors in engagement behavior.

By following these steps rigorously with a controlled experiment design approach while ensuring sufficient randomness sampling across various audiences can ensure the reliability & validity of H3 hypothesis.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"Direct Mailers with 'Value First' message receive three times more replies compared to those without the 'Value First' messaging."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Number of DMs Sent:** Total Direct Mail pieces sent out, split into two groups: 
  - Group A (with "Value First")
  - Group B (without "Value First")

- **Replies Received**: Count and record all replies received from both direct mailers.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Conduct a small-scale test with at least:
1. Minimum of 200 DMs sent to each group.
2. Track the number of responses for an equal amount in Group A (with "Value First") as well as Group B without it over one month period, ensuring consistent demographic targeting and content aside from 'Value First'.

## METRIC
- **Response Rate Increase Factor**: Measure how much more often replies are received by comparing:
  - Response rate of DM with ValueFirst (responses per direct mail sent)
  - Standard response rate for DMs without it

An outcome showing a factor greater than or equal to `3` confirms the hypothesis.

## DECISION RULE
- **If**: The mean number of responses from Group A divided by that in Group B is ≥ 3, and statistical testing (like Chi-Square test) shows significance.
- **Then Y**: Accept H5 ("Value First" DMs get three times more replies).

### Statistical Test to Apply:
Use a Two-Proportion Z-Test for the observed response rates of both groups.

This experiment design provides clarity on how you can evaluate your hypothesis rigorously, focusing only minimally while ensuring statistically significant results. Adjustments may be necessary based upon initial outcomes or unforeseen variables affecting data collection and analysis processes.

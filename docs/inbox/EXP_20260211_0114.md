## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of conversions (clicks leading to action such as purchase or sign-up) for each type of advertisement sent by the emails. 
- Total number of ads clicked on per day over a specified period.
- Overall performance metrics including open rates and click-through rates differentiated between aggressive vs polite copy.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To achieve 80% confidence, we will need to run an experiment with around **2000** total ad impressions split evenly into two groups (aggressive & polite). Half of the sample randomly receives ads from both versions. We'll measure conversion and other metrics for each group independently over a week.

## METRIC
- Number of conversions per 100 clicks.
  
We want to see if aggressive copy produces more than **20%** better results compared with polite copies (CTR > X%).

## DECISION RULE

If the number of conversions in both versions are similar, we reject H1. If at least one version shows significantly higher conversion rates (>X%), and this difference is statistically significant using a Chi-Square test or Fisher's Exact Test for proportions.

**Note:** The sample size needs to be calculated based on statistical power analysis (e.g., G*Power software). We aim 80% confidence level, with significance set at p < .05. We also want an effect size of d = X%. This would require approximately **2000 total ads**, split evenly between aggressive and polite versions.

**Statistical Power Analysis Output:**
- Sample Size Required for Aggressive vs Polite Comparison (95% CI)
  - Expected proportion difference (d): 20%
  - Alpha level (.05): Significance
  - Statistical power (.80) = Probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis, when it is false.
  
## Randomization and Control Measures

We need to ensure that any confounding variables are controlled:

- Split randomly into two groups: one receiving aggressive copy (Group A), another polite version (Group B).
- Equalize other factors like ad design elements except for text content.

**Note:** In a real-world scenario, we would ideally test with different demographics and settings. 

This is just an initial rough draft of the experiment's proposed framework; it may require adjustments as new variables come to light or if sample sizes need fine-tuning based on actual observed performance differences between aggressive vs polite ad copy.

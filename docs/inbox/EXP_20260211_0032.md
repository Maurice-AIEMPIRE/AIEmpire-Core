## HYPOTHESIS:
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### 1. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Engagement Metrics:** Number of likes, comments, and shares from posts made exclusively during the time slot (e.g., between midnight to 4 AM Pacific Time).
- **Time Zone Data:** Geolocation data indicating that users interacting with these postings are located on US West Coast.
- **Demographic Information**: Age groups or professional interests linked specifically for engineers within those demographics.

### 2. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Create a series of posts at different times including:
1. A post made exclusively between midnight to 4 AM Pacific Time (target time slot).
2. Additional comparable control postings outside this window, e.g., noon and evening hours.
3. Track the engagement metrics for each posting within both targeted US West Coast region-specific audience groups.

### 3. METRIC
- **Engagement Rate:** Number of interactions per post divided by total impressions (likes + comments) during those time slots compared to control postings outside that window should be > X% confidence level, ideally around <5%.
  
Example Metric:
```
(Clicks and engagement from posts made at target times / Clicks and engagements in general across all hours)
> 2%
```

### 4. DECISION RULE
- **If:** Engagement rate for the targeted time slot (midnight to 4 AM Pacific Time) is significantly higher than control postings outside this window.
    - Then: Conclude that posts made at these times capture US West Coast engineers.

Example:
```markdown
IF engagement_rate_mid_2AM > average_engagement_rate_control_past_hours THEN H2 holds true ELSE reconsider hypothesis or further test additional factors influencing engagement rates.
```

This experiment provides a structured approach to validate whether posting specifically during 2 AM Pacific Time indeed captures US West Coast engineers by measuring significant differences in user interaction metrics. The fast and smallest possible experimental setup ensures quick acquisition of meaningful data for informed decisions.

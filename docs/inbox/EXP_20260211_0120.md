## Hypothesis
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis effectively we need the following data points:
- Number of times a user clicks on "bookmark" button for each thread type ("How-to" and "Why-to").
- Total number of views (visits) to both types of posts within an equal timeframe.
  
The dataset should be collected over a significant period where 'How-to' threads are posted regularly alongside equivalent frequency postings in the form of 'Why-to'.

## Fastest Experiment
We can start by collecting data from 100 randomly selected "How-to" and "Why-to" thread interactions each day for one week. Assuming we have an average user engagement level, this might give us a robust enough dataset to test our hypothesis with confidence.

- We will need at least two weeks of daily interaction metrics collected via web analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics).

## Metric
We should focus on the Click-through Rate (CTR) for bookmarks in both thread types:
- CTR_How-to = Number_of_bookmarks_How-to / Total_views_How-to.
- CTR_Why-to = Number_of_bookmarks_Why-to / Total_views_Why-to.

Our goal is to observe if there exists a statistically significant difference between these two metrics. To achieve 80% confidence, we might target achieving at least this much of variance in our sample data:
  
METRIC: A noticeable and consistent increase (>5%) in CTR for 'How-to' threads compared with the baseline measured against historical averages.

## Decision Rule
If after one week (or less) observing daily metrics:

- The average CTR_How-to > 1.05 * Average_CTR_Why-to,
  
Then we reject H0 ("There is no difference") in favor of Ha (“How-to threads get more bookmarks than Why-to”).

This result would indicate a statistically significant preference for bookmarking 'How-to' content over equivalent frequency posts categorized as "Why-to", thus supporting our hypothesis. If not, then the data does not support such strong evidence and further investigation with an extended dataset may be warranted.

## Notes
- A confidence interval (CI) of 95% can also give a range within which we are confident that it contains the true mean difference between CTR_How-to and CTR_Why-to.
  
Additionally, this experiment assumes equal exposure opportunities for both thread types. Unequal promotion or visibility could skew results toward one type's interaction metrics unfairly.

Adjustments may be necessary based on initial findings – such as increasing sample size if variance is low (unlikely) to ensure a robust test of the hypothesis with sufficient power.

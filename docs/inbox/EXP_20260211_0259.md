# Experiment Design for Testing Viral Meme Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. The time it takes (in hours/days/weeks) from the meme's creation to when its view count reaches 10,000 views.
2. Total number of shares/likes/comments received by each meme within a week after reaching 10,000 views for memes with code snippets and those without.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Create two groups (Group A: Memes with Code Snippets; Group B: Memes Without Code) on social media platforms like Reddit or Twitter. Each group should consist of around 50 unique meme posts initially created simultaneously.
- Track the time until each post reaches at least 10,000 views.

## METRIC:
The difference in average times taken for memes to reach 10,000 views between Group A and Group B will be monitored closely (e.g., if Group A's mean is less than Group B by a statistically significant margin within an hour).

- **Decision Rule:** If the time it takes for memes with code snippets on social media platforms goes viral faster compared to those without in 80% of cases, then we conclude that H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

## DECISION RULE:
If Group A reaches its virality milestone (10K views) significantly sooner than Group B within the shortest time frame possible for an average meme post on social media platforms and this trend is consistently observed across multiple posts in both groups, then conclude that memes containing coding concepts do indeed have a higher viral potential.

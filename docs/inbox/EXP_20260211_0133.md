# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "How-to" Threads Get More Bookmarks Than 'Why-to'

## HYPOTHESIS
H3 states that how-to threads get more bookmarks than why-to threads.

**Hypothesis:** How-to thread posts receive significantly higher numbers of bookmark clicks compared to Why-to post links over a fixed period.


## EVIDENCE REQUIRED

- Number of "How-To" and "Why-To" post URLs tracked on the website.
- The total number of visits for each type (H3: H-T, W-T).
- Click-through rates indicating how many visitors bookmark posts ("How-To": Y_HT; Why-to": Y_WT).


## FASTEST EXPERIMENT

To achieve 80% confidence in a fast experiment setup:

1. Track the first two weeks of post visits and bookmarks for both How-to (H) and Why-to (W).
2. Ensure an equal number of H-T and W-T posts are published during this period to control other variables.

**Target:** Collect data on Y_HT and Y_WT.


## METRIC

The primary metric is the click-through rate, specifically:

- "How-To" Post Clicks as a Percentage (Y_HTPCT): Total clicks from H-T divided by total visits of H.
- Why-to Posts Click Rate: Total bookmarks to why posts links in W / Total visits for Y_WT.


**Goal:** Determine if Y_HTPCT > Y_WT and the difference is statistically significant with an 80% confidence level, signifying a preference toward bookmarking How-To threads over Why-to ones. 


## DECISION RULE

- If Y_HTPCT - Y_WT > Critical Value (determined via statistical significance test) + Margin of Error for desired confidence interval: YES.
    Then the hypothesis H3 is supported; how-to posts are getting significantly more bookmarks compared to why-to post links.

- Otherwise, NO. Further investigation or a revised experiment may be required.


**Note:** The margin and critical values depend on your sample size (n) which would have been determined during pre-experiment planning phase for reaching an 80% confidence interval as per statistical standards like the t-test.

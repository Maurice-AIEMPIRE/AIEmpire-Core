# Experiment Design for Testing H5 Hypothesis

## Hypothesis:
H0: DMs with 'Value First' do not get three times more replies than others.

HA: DM posts that include the phrase "Value First" receive 3x as many responses compared to those without it, controlling other factors influencing engagement.


## Evidence Required:

1. Count of total comments on a sample set of Direct Messages (DMs) with 'Value First' vs DMs lacking this phrase.
2. Control variables: Type and context of the original post that generated DM replies.

3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
   - Sample Size Calculation for 80% Confidence Level

      Assuming prior knowledge or pilot testing indicates an average difference in responses (effect size), calculate sample sizes using power analysis methods, such as G*Power.
      
4. METRIC: Difference Ratio
      
     Measured Metric = Number of Replies to 'Value First' DMs / Total Responses on original post with corresponding DM
  
5. DECISION RULE:
  
  If the observed difference ratio is greater than or equal to 3 (suggesting three times as many replies), then reject H0 in favor of HA.
  

## Sample Size Calculation:

- To get an 80% confidence level, assuming a medium effect size and aiming for power above 90%, we would need approximately X number of DMs posted with 'Value First' compared to Y without it.

(Exact sample sizes are dependent on the calculated standard deviation from pilot data or prior studies.)

## Data Collection Procedure:

1. Randomly select DM responses.
2. Record whether each reply is part of a conversation that started as an original post containing "Value First".
3. Compare against control group DMs not featuring this phrase.

**Note:** This experiment requires careful consideration to avoid bias and ensure the random selection process for both groups (those with 'Value First' vs those without it). External factors affecting response rates should also be identified, controlled or accounted for in analysis.

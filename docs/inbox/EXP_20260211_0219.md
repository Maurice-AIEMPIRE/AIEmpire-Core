## Hypothesis
H3 states that 'How-to' threads receive more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. Therefore:
- **Hypothesis** (H): The average number of bookmarks per post in the "How-to" category is greater than those received by posts labeled as belonging to a hypothetical comparable, equally populated and active thread's category named "Why-to".

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis effectively we need several pieces of data:
1. Number of 'How-to' threads available on Reddit.
2. Total number of posts in each 'How-to' thread (to ensure comparability).
3. Average number bookmarks received per post within all the aggregated or sampled "Why-to" categories.

## Fastest Experiment
The quickest way to test this hypothesis would be by sampling:
1. Randomly select a small but statistically significant portion from both available populations ('How-to' and comparable 'Why-to') ensuring that they are equally populated (or have similar activity levels) for the sake of comparison.
2. Measure bookmarks received per post in these sampled posts.

## Metric
The main metric to watch would be:
- **Bookmark Count Per Post**: We need a mean bookmark count from both categories and compare them directly, aiming at an average difference that provides 80% confidence (based on standard deviation).

### Confidence Level Calculation Example:

Using the z-score for estimating population means with known variance when sample sizes are reasonably large (>30), typically you can achieve up to about 95.45% confidence using a margin of error formula: 
\( ME = Z * (\sigma/\sqrt{n}) \) 

Where:
- \(Z\): Z-value (1.96 for approximately 95% CI)
- \(\sigma\): Standard deviation from the sampled data
- n: Sample size

## Decision Rule
If after sampling and measurement, we observe that **Bookmark Count Per Post** in 'How-to' threads is significantly higher than those observed within all aggregated or representative samples of comparable "Why-to" categories with 80% confidence level (i.e., mean bookmark difference greater by a margin calculated through above mentioned formula), then:
- We would accept the hypothesis.

Conversely, if there's no significant disparity after applying statistical tests to our sample data and observing bookmarks per post between 'How-to' threads versus "Why-to" categories,
then we must reject H3; suggesting that there isn't sufficient evidence from sampled posts alone (as limited by 80% confidence level) supporting the hypothesis.

## Implementation Steps
1. Randomly select a statistically significant portion of both available populations ("How-to", comparable sample sizes).
2. Measure and record bookmarks received per post for these samples.
3. Analyze data to compare mean bookmark counts, applying statistical tests (like t-tests or ANOVA depending on variance homogeneity) as required ensuring 80% confidence level criteria is met.

**Note:** Real-world limitations like availability of "Why-to" categories with comparable activity levels can influence this experiment's accuracy and feasibility directly.

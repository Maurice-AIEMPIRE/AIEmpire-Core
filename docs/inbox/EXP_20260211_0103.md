# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H5"

## HYPOTHESIS:
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of DMs sent using the standard format (control group) and number containing 'Value First'.
2. Total responses received from each DM type.
3. Distribution breakdown: positive, negative or neutral feedback for both groups.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
To get 80% confidence in this hypothesis we can perform an A/B test with at least two weeks of data collection to reach statistical significance and ensure a diverse sample pool representing different demographics (gender, age group etc).

A preliminary experiment using one week’s worth of collected responses could be run as follows: 
- Send out **X** DMs containing the standard format over this period
- At some point during sending these messages we can send X amount that have 'Value First' instead.

## METRIC:
The key metric is "Total Responses" divided by 2 for both groups (standard DM and ValueFirst). In other words, total number of replies per day/duration. We are interested in the difference between them which should be three times greater if our hypothesis holds true.
We can also track 'positive feedback' as a secondary indicator.

## DECISION RULE:
If "Total Responses" for DMs containing 'Value First' is 3x larger compared to control group, then we conclude that H5 has been proven. If not (i.e., less than two times the response rate), it can be rejected.
The statistical significance should reach at least a confidence level of 80%.

**NOTE:**

If after running this test for one week and analyzing results with above metrics you still cannot confirm our hypothesis, we would need to run additional experiments/iteration until either confirmation or rejection.

We may also want to add more dimensions as needed (e.g. gender breakdown) in subsequent iterations.

# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

## Evidence Required:
- Conversion rates for both aggressive and polite copies over a specified period of time. This includes data points like the number of clicks, conversions (or desired outcomes), total impressions/shares/views/readership counts etc.
  
## Fastest Experiment
To achieve an 80% confidence level in testing this hypothesis with minimal resources:

1. Randomly select two groups from your target audience pool that are statistically similar except for their exposure to either aggressive or polite copy.
2. Display the respective copies (aggressive vs polite) on platforms where these audiences will interact naturally over a period of time - like social media ads, landing pages etc.

## Metric
- Compare conversion rates between both groups at different intervals until you achieve 80% confidence level in your results i.e., sufficient data points collected to confidently assert any difference (or lack thereof).

The primary metric we are interested is the **conversion rate**. We need it for two reasons:
1. Conversion implies that there has been an action taken by someone after seeing our copy.
2. It directly relates with what we're trying to measure, i.e., how good or effective a piece of text (aggressive vs polite) can be in converting people into customers.

## Decision Rule
If the conversion rate for aggressive copies is 20% higher than that observed from politeness within an acceptable margin-of-error and after reaching sufficient data points collected at intervals to achieve our targeted confidence level, then we would conclude:

- Aggressive copy converts **X** times better (where X = specific percentage increase calculated based on actual results) compared with polite copies.

If not - it can be safely concluded that there isn't enough evidence supporting H1 and thus aggressive vs. politeness doesn't affect conversion rate significantly at a confidence level of 80%. 

Note: The metric, decision rule used here could vary depending upon the nature/objective/functionality/requirements related to your experiment.

## Experiment Design

### Hypothesis:
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

### Evidence Required:

1. Number of initial posts for both types ('How-to' and 'Why-to').
2. Time frame (e.g., 30 days) over which the data will be collected.
3. Total number of unique visitors to each type's thread in that time period.

### Fastest Experiment:
- Set up two new threads: one labeled as a "How-to" guide, another marked simply with text indicating it is for educational purposes (without specifying it's 'Why-to').
- Monitor and collect the following data points daily until reaching 80% confidence level:

    - Number of unique visitors.
    - Total bookmarks count at various intervals.

### Metric:
The primary metric will be **Total Bookmarks Count** on each thread. We aim to see if one type consistently receives a higher bookmark rate compared with its counterpart over the observation period (e.g., 80% confidence level).

- Example Target: If 'How-to' threads are expected to get more bookmarks, we would ideally reach at least an **85% increase in total bookmarks** on average for every visitor as opposed to the control group ('Why-to').

### Decision Rule:
If:

    - The mean number of unique visitors per day is statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05) and/or
    - Bookmarks received by 'How-to' threads are consistently at least **85% greater** than those for similar durations on the "Why-to" thread,

Then we can conclude that there’s a significant difference in bookmarking behavior favoring ‘How-to’ over “Why-to”.

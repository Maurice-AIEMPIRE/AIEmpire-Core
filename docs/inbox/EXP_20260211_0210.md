# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- **Conversion Rate (CR)** of aggressive copies compared to polite copies. We need data points representing the conversion rates from both types.
  
---
 
## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

To achieve an 80% confidence level, we can conduct a smaller scale A/B test initially followed by sequential testing until sufficient evidence is gathered.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Split visitors into two groups: Group A (polite copy) and Group B (aggressive copy).
   
2. **A/B Testing Phase I**:
   - Run the initial experiment for a short duration, say 3 days.
   - Collect conversion data from both versions.

---

## METRIC:

- We need to measure Conversion Rate (CR), defined as:  
\[ \text{Conversion Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Conversions}}{\text{Total Number of Impressions or Clicks}} \]

We should aim for a difference in CR between aggressive and polite copies that justifies the hypothesis.

**Target Metric:** Difference ≥ 20% (i.e., Aggressive copy → X%, Polite copy → Y%)

---

## DECISION RULE:

- **Decision Threshold:**
   - If after Phase I, we achieve an observed conversion rate difference of at least 20%.
  
If Observed CR for Group A = \( \text{CR}_A \) and Observed CR for Group B = \( \text{CR}_B \):
\[ (\text{CR}_B - \text{CR}_A) / |(\text{CR}_A + \text{CR}_B)/2| ≥ 0.20 \]

If true, we conclude that aggressive copy converts significantly better than polite.

Otherwise:
- Collect more data and repeat the test until a statistically significant difference is observed.

This structured approach ensures rigorous testing while adhering to minimal resource usage by validating hypothesis through controlled smaller-scale experiments first before scaling up if initial results are promising.

# Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS:
H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- A/B testing dataset with the following data points for each variation (aggressive vs. polite):
  - Conversion rate (%)
  - Click-through rates (CTR) in percentages
  - Total number of impressions

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

### Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence Interval Estimation:
1. **Sample Size Calculation**: 
   Use a sample size calculator for A/B testing with the following inputs.
   
2. **Randomly Split Traffic (50/50)** into two groups - Group A using aggressive copy and Group B using polite copy.

3. Run this split for 24 hours, collecting data on conversions/clicks from each group till we have enough samples to achieve statistical significance at a confidence level of 80%.

4. **Monitor Conversion Rates** continuously until significant variance is detected between the two groups or time limit expires (use Z-test as it generally provides quick convergence).

## METRIC:
- Exact number: The conversion rate for both aggressive and polite copy needs monitoring.
  
For an experiment to test H1 with at least 80% confidence level, we need a minimum of ~10 conversions/100 clicks per variation assuming normal distribution. However depending on actual observed variance in the population (which can be estimated via pilot testing), this figure could vary.

### Target Metrics for Decision Making:
- Aggressive copy conversion rate > Polite Copy Conversion Rate by at least 2% to achieve H1.
  
## DECISION RULE: 
If aggressive copy has a significantly higher CTR or more than politer copy, then we conclude that 'aggressive copy converts better.'

Note: Statistical significance is assumed here using Z-test for quick convergence. Further statistical tests (like T-tests) can also be used based on the actual variance observed in pilot testing.

# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis:
H0: Memes with code snippets do not go viral faster than memes without code snippets.

HA: H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster (measured by spread rate and engagement metrics) compared to memes without code snippets over the same time period.
```

```markdown
# Evidence Required

1. Number of shares, likes, comments for each meme shared on social media platforms within a given timeframe.

2. Engagement data such as retweets/shares/comments per unique user reached by sharing said memes with and without code snippets separately (to control viral spread effects).

3. Demographic information about the users who share/momentarily interact with these posts to ensure uniform audience characteristics for fairness in comparison.
```

```markdown
# Fastest Experiment

1. Identify a diverse sample of social media platforms popular among meme sharers, such as Instagram and Reddit.

2. Collect data from 10 memes shared on each platform (totaling approximately five different time periods) with code snippets included versus without over the same timeframe to establish trends in viral spread.
```

```markdown
# Metric

1. Number of shares/comments per unique user reached by sharing said meme: 

    a. Meme with Code Snippets - Target for 80% confidence interval (CI): X > Y%

2. Engagement rate:

    a. Post engagement metric increase percentage over control memes without code snippets, aiming to hit at least an X percent difference in favor of the H4 hypothesis.
```

```markdown
# Decision Rule

If shares/comments per unique user reached for meme with code snippet (X) is significantly greater than those observed when sharing similar content but excluding any form of coding languages or other programming elements (Y), then we accept HA: memes containing codes snippets go viral faster compared to their counterparts without.

## Hypothesis
H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

## Evidence Required 
1. Number of shares on social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit).
2. Time taken for a meme to reach 1000 views and beyond after being posted online.
3. Engagement rates including likes, comments per post over time period t days after posting the original content from both groups: memes with code snippets vs without.

## Fastest Experiment
Creating an equal amount of two different sets (one set containing codes snippets in them; one contains none) meme and spreading this on social media platforms like Twitter or Reddit to see how many people share, comment & engage each post. 

- Select a sample population who are active participants across multiple online communities.
  
## Metric
The key metric should be the rate at which memes with code snippets go viral compared to those without:

1. Viralization Speed: Measured as time taken for meme (both sets) reaching 1000 views and beyond after being posted.

2. Engagement Rate: Number of likes, comments per post over a given period t days from posting original content.
    
## Decision Rule
If memes with code snippets have an engagement rate that exceeds the baseline by at least 80% compared to those without them within any chosen time frame (e.g., first week), then we can conclude H4.

Note: The experiment must be conducted over a significant period and across various social media platforms for accurate results. Also, it is crucial not to use copyrighted code snippets or images in memes as this could violate copyright laws.

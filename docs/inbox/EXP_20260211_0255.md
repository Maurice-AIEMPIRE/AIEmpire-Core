# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H2: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers"

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
**H0 (Null hypothesis): There is no significant increase in engagement from posting on social media targeting the time slot of 2 AM among users located within the U.S. West Coast region, compared to other timeslots and locations.

**HA (Alternative Hypothesis - Alternative hypothesis you are testing for): Posting at 2 AM results in a significantly higher level of user interaction specifically targeted toward US West Coast engineers on social media platforms such as LinkedIn or Twitter.


## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To support HA, we need the following data points:
- Number and type (engagement) of interactions with posts made exactly at 2 AM.
    - Metrics could include likes, comments, shares by users specifically identified to be located on US West Coast through location metadata or self-reported information if feasible.


## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A small-scale test can involve the following steps:
1. Select a social media platform popular among engineers (e.g., LinkedIn).
2. Create two posts with identical content: one scheduled for posting at precisely 2 AM, and another post randomly placed outside of this time slot.
3. Run these postings simultaneously over different days or weeks to mitigate day-of-the-week effects.

## 4. METRIC
- Compare the engagement rate (e.g., likes + comments per interaction) from posts made specifically around noon for control purposes versus those posted at exactly 2 AM.


## 5. DECISION RULE: If X, then Y.
**X:** Engagement metrics are significantly higher when comparing interactions with a post scheduled to go live strictly during the designated time slot of interest (at precisely 2 AM) against other timeslots.

**Y:** This would lead us directly towards HA being true — that posting at this specific hour captures US West Coast engineers. Conversely, if there is no significant difference in engagement metrics between posts made around noon and those scheduled for exactly 2 AM then H0 remains plausible indicating the targeted time slot does not result in significantly different interaction levels among users located on U.S. West Coasts.

*Note*: In real-world scenarios further details would be needed to address potential confounders such as day of week, holidays or special events which could influence engagement patterns.

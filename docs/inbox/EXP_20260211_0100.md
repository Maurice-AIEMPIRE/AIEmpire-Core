# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
- H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts.

```markdown
HYPOTHESIS: How-to posts receive significantly higher numbers of bookmark clicks compared to Why-to posts on a given platform over the same time period. 
```

### Evidence Required:
We need quantitative data for both types ('How-to', and 'Why-to') threads, with at least:

- Total number of each type posted in an identical timeframe.
- Number of bookmarks clicked per post.

```markdown
EVIDENCE REQUIRED: A dataset containing the following information over a comparable period (e.g., 30 days):
1. The total count for both How-to and Why-to posts created during this time frame on our platform.
2. Count of bookmark clicks received by each individual 'How-to' thread post within that same timeframe.

Additionally, we need demographic data if applicable to control variables such as user experience or knowledge levels across different regions/countries which might influence bookmarking behavior independently from the content's nature (How-to vs Why-to).
```

### Fastest Experiment:
Assuming a social media platform where posts can be tagged and monitored for real-time statistics:

```markdown
FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Randomly sample 100 'How-to' threads to track over one week.
Randomly sample another set of an equal number (e.g., if we sampled How-its, we'll also need the same quantity from Why-tos) at random times within that period for direct comparison on bookmarking activity. We would use real-time monitoring tools provided by social media platforms or third-party applications capable of capturing this data.
```

### Metric:
```markdown
METRIC: Mean Bookmark Clicks per Post.

The average number bookmark clicks received per post in each sample set ('How-to' vs 'Why-to') must exceed 2% (or another predefined benchmark) for us to consider it statistically significant and reject the null hypothesis. A quick preliminary calculation can be done if we assume a baseline click rate of about X%, where this would need adjustment based on historical data.
```

### Decision Rule:
```markdown
DECISION RULE: If the mean bookmark clicks per post in 'How-to' threads exceed that for Why-to posts by 80% or more, reject H3. This threshold must be adjusted according to our initial benchmark set out above.

Note this is a simplification; real-world experiments might need adjustments based on preliminary data.
```

**Additional Consideration:**

- Ensure the sample size of 'How-to' and 'Why-to' threads are comparable in terms of content length, posting time (day/night), tags used etc., as these factors could influence bookmarking behavior independently from thread type.

- Use statistical methods to analyze collected bookmark click data for each post. Basic t-tests or ANOVA tests can help determine if observed differences between groups ('How-to' vs 'Why-to') are statistically significant and not due to random chance.


**Notes:**

- This experiment design prioritizes simplicity, aiming at gathering sufficient evidence in the shortest timeframe possible while maintaining statistical relevance.

- Adjustments for variables like user demographics might be necessary depending on data availability from social platforms.

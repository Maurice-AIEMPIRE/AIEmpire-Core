# Experiment Design for Testing H2 Hypothesis

## **1. Hypothesis**

**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### **2. Evidence Required**
To test this hypothesis effectively:

- **Posting Frequency Data (DF):** Number of posts made by individuals identified as belonging to the engineering community on social media platforms.
  
- **Time Stamps for Posts and User Profiles:**

  - Time when each post was created
  - Location inferred from user profiles or IP addresses
  
- **Demographic Information:** Whether these users can be classified specifically into US West Coast engineers.

---

### **3. Fastest Experiment**
A small test to gain an initial understanding:

1. Identify and follow at least a few dozen active accounts of known engineering professionals (verified through social media checks).
2. Monitor the time they post content over two weeks.
3. Record if any posts occur around 2 AM Eastern Time.

**Sample Size:** At least **50 engineers**

---

### **4. Metric**
- **Posting Frequency at Target Times: CTR > X%**, where `X` is set based on initial observations to achieve an 80% confidence level (e.g., *0.5% posting frequency*).

---

### **5. Decision Rule**
**If:** A statistically significant portion of posts from US West Coast engineers occur around 2 AM Eastern Time.

- Then hypothesize that there may be a pattern or behavior indicating interest in this time slot.
  
Otherwise:

- Conclude there's no substantial evidence to support H2 at an 80% confidence level, suggesting the hypothesis doesn't hold for these users.

### Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "H5: DMs with 'Value First' get 3x more replies."

#### 1. HYPOTHESIS:
- Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in reply rates between direct messages mentioning 'Value First' and those that do not.
- Alternative hypothesis (Ha): Direct messages mentioning 'Value First' receive three times the number of replies compared to those without.

#### 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
To test this, we need data points on two variables for a significant sample size from both groups:

1. **Number of DMs received:** Total count per day/week/month.
   - Group A: Direct messages mentioning 'Value First'.
   - Group B: Direct messages not mentioning 'Value First'.

2. **Reply rates**:
    - Average number of replies each DM receives in a given time frame (e.g., 24 hours, one week).
    
#### 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
- Select an initial period for the experiment to be conducted quickly but long enough that it can provide statistically significant data.
  
For instance: **7 days** would give sufficient variance and response rate differences.

1. Send a batch of DMs mentioning 'Value First' (Group A) as per average daily interactions over 7 consecutive periods, totaling approximately 1000 messages for both groups combined if historical interaction rates are ~150/day on avg.
2. Collect responses to measure the reply count within these time frames and calculate respective means.

#### 4. METRIC:
- Average number of replies DM received in a given timeframe per group (Group A: mentioning 'Value First', Group B: not).

**Decision Metric:**  
The average rate for DMs with "Value First" should be at least **three times higher than the non-'Value First' messages**, i.e., if CTR for Non-‘ValueFirst’ is X%, then it needs to show that CTR with 'Value First' equals 3X%.

#### 5. DECISION RULE:
If on average, Group A (DMs mentioning "Value First") receives **at least three times more replies** than Group B within the chosen period of observation compared to historical data:

- Reject H0.
  
Otherwise,

- Fail to reject H0.

```

This experiment design aims at providing a robust analysis using an 80% confidence interval based on collected DM interactions over seven days, allowing for statistical significance while keeping it minimal in duration. Adjustments can be made as more precise or extended observation periods are feasible and desired.

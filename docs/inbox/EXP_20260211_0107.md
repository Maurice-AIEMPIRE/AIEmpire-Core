# Experiment Design for Testing Meme Virality Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. **Number of Shares** - Total shares on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit).
2. **Time to First Share** – Time taken for the first share after posting.
3. **Engagement Rate per Post** – Number and type of interactions such as likes/comments/shares divided by total views or impressions.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Create two sets of memes with similar content but one set containing code snippets embedded within them (e.g., using HTML/CSS). The other set contains the same meme content without any coding elements. Post these on a popular social media platform and collect data over 24 hours for both groups.

### METRIC:
- **Time to First Share**: Track how long it takes each post from either group to receive its first share.
- **Total Shares within 1 Hour of Posting (SH)**: The total number of shares that occur in the hour after posting. 

Aim for a statistically significant difference with at least an 80% confidence level.

### DECISION RULE:
If posts containing code snippets have significantly fewer hours until their first share and more initial engagement/shares compared to non-code-embedded memes, then we conclude "H4 is supported: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## Summary
We will measure the time taken for a meme post's first sharing (Time to First Share) as well as total shares within one hour of posting. A statistically significant difference in these metrics between coded and non-coded memes, at an 80% confidence level or better using methods such as t-tests on mean values across both groups' posts will indicate that H4 is supported.

### Data Collection
- **Platform**: Twitter/Redddit/Instagram.
- **Data Points Collected per Post for Both Groups (coded and non-coded)**:
    - Time to First Share in seconds/minutes/hours.
    - Total Shares within 1 hour of posting.

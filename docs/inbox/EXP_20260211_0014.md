## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

---

### 1. **HYPOTHESIS**
We hypothesize that posting content targeted specifically for the time slot of 2 AM will significantly increase engagement among US West Coast-based social media users, particularly those working as software developers or in tech industries.

### 2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED: What data points do we need?**

To test this hypothesis rigorously:

1. Engagement Metrics (CTR - Click-Through Rate)
   - Number of clicks on posts made at 2 AM.
   
2. Demographic Data
   - Location verification to ensure the audience is primarily from US West Coast states.

3. Professional Background Verification
   - Identification that users engaged with these post belong mostly in tech industries or software development roles (using interests, professional links shared).

4. Control Group Engagement Metrics:
   - Number of clicks on posts made at other times for comparison.
   
### 3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest test to get 80% confidence**

- Run a targeted ad campaign across various platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter specifically aimed towards software engineers located in US West Coast states, posting content around the time slot of 2 AM.

**Target Audience Size:** At least an initial sample size that statistically gives us enough power (e.g., at least 5000 unique engagements split into two groups - posts made targeting different times).

### 4. **METRIC: Exact number to watch**

- CTR for targeted post = Number of clicks / Total impressions.
  
**Target Metric:** 
   Target Click-through rate >2% with a margin error that ensures an 80% confidence interval.

### 5. **DECISION RULE: If X, then Y**
   
**Rule Definition:**
1. Calculate the observed CTR for posts made at targeted times (e.g., during peak hours).
2. Compare this against control group metrics posted outside these time slots.
3. Evaluate if significant increase in engagement is evident from US West Coast engineers.

**Decision Rule:** 
- If Targeted Engagement Metrics (CTR) > Control Group's average by 20% or more, then accept the hypothesis that posting at targeted times captures a higher rate of desired audience interaction and conclude "Posting at 2 AM significantly increases user engagements among US West Coast tech professionals."

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
*H1*: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis rigorously and ensure we collect the necessary data points effectively:

- **Post Timing Data**: Log timestamps of posts made on platforms frequented by engineering professionals (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter).
- **Location Metadata**: Collect geolocation information to confirm that users are located in US West Coast regions.
- **Engagement Metrics**:
  - Number and type of interactions with the post (likes, shares, comments).

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To achieve an 80% confidence level swiftly:

1. Select a platform popular among engineers such as LinkedIn or Twitter.
2. Schedule posts to be published at various times: including but not limited to:
   - Midnight (12 AM)
   - Early Morning (3 AM, 4 AM) 
   - Mid-Morning (9 AM)

### Metrics
- **Engagement Rate** for each post time slot.

A smaller test would involve posting during the specified hours on a day when there's expected low engagement from US West Coast engineers to ensure any increase in activity is due to our hypothesis and not random variance. We need at least 20 posts per hour with clear location tags enabled (for verification).

---

### Decision Rule
- **If** we observe that:
   - The number of interactions significantly exceeds the baseline average interaction rate for non-West Coast times.
   - Engagement metrics like likes, shares or comments are substantially higher during early morning hours.

Then,

*Y*: Conclude *H1: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.*

Otherwise:

- Y: Do not conclude that posting specifically around midnight has a significant impact on capturing the target audience compared to other times of day. Adjust hypotheses and experiment accordingly for further testing in different time slots or with varied content.

### Example Decision Table
| Time Slot       | Engagement Rate (%) |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 12 AM            | X%                    |
| Midnight (2 AM) | Y%(Expected Increase if H1 is true: > X%) |

- If `Y %` significantly exceeds the baseline interaction rate for times other than midnight, then *H1* can be confirmed.
- Otherwise, further investigation or adjustments to test conditions are needed.

---

### Conclusion
This structured experiment design will enable us systematically and efficiently evaluate whether our hypothesis holds true by focusing on real-time data collection aligned with targeted hypotheses testing. Adjustments may include increasing sample sizes for higher confidence levels if initial results don’t meet the 80% criterion.

# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
Memes with code snippets go viral faster compared to memes without code snippets.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. **Views Count** (VC): Number of views each meme receives over a given period.
2. **Shares and Likes Ratio (SLR)**: The ratio between the number of shares/likes divided by total engagements per post for both types of memes with identical content but differing only in having code snippets versus not.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Create 10 pairs of similar viral meme templates, one pair containing a common theme and embedded simple popular coding language (e.g., Python) snippet relevant to the context.
2. One copy from each pair should contain no additional content beyond its inherent humor or concept; this will serve as our control group memes without code snippets.

## METRIC:

- **Engagement Growth Rate**: The change in shares/likes ratio over 24 hours (percentage increase). We need an engagement growth rate of at least a 25% higher share/like for the meme with embedded codes compared to its respective non-code-snippet counterpart.
  
## DECISION RULE:
If memes containing code snippets show greater than or equal to **a 25%** faster Engagement Growth Rate in comparison to their control counterparts, we conclude that "Memes with code snippets go viral faster." 

We will run this experiment for a minimum of one week before analyzing the data due to potential external factors impacting virality (e.g., holidays), and we'll gather enough sample size across multiple themes/titles/data points.

## DATA COLLECTION:

- Use web scraping tools or APIs available on popular meme-sharing platforms.
- Tag memes by their content type ("with code snippet" vs. "without code") for easy comparison after data collection phase completion.


Ensure that all collected data is anonymized and complies with the privacy policies of respective social media sites to respect user confidentiality.

We will consider this experiment completed if our engagement growth metric shows a statistically significant difference between memes containing simple codes versus those without, achieving an 80% confidence interval.

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy."

**H0 (Null Hypothesis):**
"Polite copies and aggressive copies have similar conversion rates, with no more than a 5% difference between them."
*Note*: The null hypothesis is formulated to be directly comparable for statistical analysis.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Conversion rate of the target audience exposed to polite copy.
- Conversion rate of the same target audience when presented aggressive copies (control).
- Sample size required based on prior conversion rates and desired confidence level/rate increase significance threshold.


We need data points representing:
a) Number of clicks or conversions for both polite and aggressive versions within a given time frame.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Smallest test to get an estimate with at least 80% confidence that there's more than the expected (e.g., not less than a significant increase if H1 is true).
- Randomly sample target audience, divide them into two groups.
    - Group A: exposed only polite copies.
    - Group B: exposed both aggressive and polite versions to measure preference/discrimination effect.

*Note*: Adjust for different sizes of exposure (e.g., ad impressions or clicks) that would allow achieving 80% confidence level.


## 4. METRIC
Exact number/percentage increase in conversion rate from the control group A when compared against Group B.
- Target metric is a significant percentage above baseline +10%, as stated by H1, i.e., an aggressive copy converting better than polite one (with more than double effectiveness).

## 5. DECISION RULE:
If the observed difference between groups exceeds our confidence threshold (+10%), then we reject *H0* and accept that there is a statistically significant conversion rate increase due to using aggressively written ad copy.

**Note:** This experiment design assumes an equal baseline performance for polite copies as well as aggressive versions before testing. Adjustments will be needed if this isn't the case.

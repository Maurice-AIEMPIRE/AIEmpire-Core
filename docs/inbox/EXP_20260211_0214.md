# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### 1. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Number of How-to Threads Bookmarked (HTB)**
- **Total Number of How-to Posts (THP)**
- **Average Bookmark Rate for How-to Posts per Day or Month**

- **Number of Why-to Threads Bookmarked (WTB)**
- **Total Number of Why-to Posts (TPW)**
- **Average Bookmark Rate for Why-to Posts per Day or Month**

### 2. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
To achieve a small sample size with an acceptable level of statistical confidence, we can track the bookmarks over two weeks.

---

#### Steps:

1. Select random samples from 'How-to' and 'Why-to' threads.
   - Number each thread for identification (e.g., H-001 to H-N; W-001 to W-M).

2. Track:
    - Total number of posts per day/week/month
    - Bookmarks received by the selected How-to Threads daily/weekly/monthly

3. Repeat this sampling process over two weeks.
   - Count bookmarks for each thread type every 24 hours.

### 3. METRIC:

- **Bookmark Rate (BR) = Total number of threads bookmarked / Total number of posts per day/week**

We aim to measure the Bookmark Rates with a minimum sample size that statistically represents both categories across different timespans.
For this experiment, we can use:
   - BR_HT: Average bookmark rate for 'How-to' Posts
   - BR_WT: Average bookmark rate for 'Why-to' Posts

---

### 4. DECISION RULE:

If **BR_HT > (1 + Confidence Level) * BR_WT**,
then "H3" hypothesis is supported.

- Example Decision Rule with a confidence level of 80%:
   If the average bookmarking ratio between How-to and Why-to threads surpasses an 80% margin, then we conclude that 'How-to' posts get more bookmarks than ‘Why-to’.

---

By using these metrics:

1. Calculate BR_HT = Total Bookmarks for all sampled "How-to" Threads / THP.
2. Calculate BR_WT = Total Bookmarks for all sampled "Why-to" Threads / TPW.

Compare the ratios:
- If BR_HT > 1 + (Confidence Level) * BR_WT, we can conclude 'H3' is supported with desired confidence level at a quicker pace compared to larger sample sizes.

# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. **Data Points Required**:
   - Time to reach 1000 shares (viral spread) of memes without a snippet vs meme with a snippet.
   - Initial engagement rate at the moment they are posted on social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or TikTok for both types.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

2. **Smallest Test**:
    We can start by posting two sets (A and B) of memes that differ only in one aspect: meme A contains a code snippet while Meme B does not contain any snippets.
   - Select 10 similar images with slight variations to serve as the baseline for both groups.

3. Measure time-to-viral spread:
    Use analytics tools provided by social media platforms or third-party services like Bitly, Hootsuite Analytics (for Twitter), etc., which can track shares and engagements in real-time.
   
4. **Metric**: 
   - Average Time to 1000 Shares
     - A1 = average time meme with snippet takes to get shared at least 1000 times by users across social media platforms within the first hour of posting (A1).
     - B1 = average time memes without snippets take to reach this benchmark.
   
5. **Decision Rule**:
    If \( T(A_i) < \frac{T(B_j)}{2} \), then H4 is supported by evidence.

### METRIC:

- Average Time-to-Viral (A1 vs B1)
  - Example Metric: A1 should be less than half of the average time it takes for meme group without snippets to go viral.
  
If we observe that memes with code snippets have consistently reached their virality benchmark faster, this would indicate support for H4.

### DECISION RULE:

- IF Average Time-to-Viral (A) < 50% * Avg. Time-To-Viral (B), THEN Meme Snippets Go Viral Faster

---

### Additional Considerations:
   
1. Control other factors like meme quality and relatability.
2. Randomize memes to ensure unbiased selection across different demographics.

By following this structured approach, we can rigorously test the hypothesis that "Memes with code snippets go viral faster" using a controlled experiment focused on measurable outcomes in social media virality rates.

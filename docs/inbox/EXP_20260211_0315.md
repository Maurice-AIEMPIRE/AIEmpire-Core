# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H2"

## HYPOTHESIS:
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. **Engagement Data** - Number of likes/comments/reactions from posts made exactly at midnight (12 AM) vs those posted around other times.
   
2. **Time Zone Distribution** - Demographic data to confirm that the targeted audience is primarily in the Pacific Time zone which includes US West Coast engineers.

3. **Traffic Source Analysis** - Where users are coming from; this could help differentiate whether they’re actually logging off for sleep or engaging with content during their awake hours.
   
4. **Engagement Duration & Conversion Rate (if applicable)** – How long do these posts stay engaged? Do interactions lead to desired outcomes like signing up, following the page/social media profile?

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Post a series of identical messages at midnight over several days for one week on different platforms.
2. Repeat this process with other time slots (e.g., 6 AM) as control groups in parallel sessions.

Use A/B testing tools to split traffic and measure engagement rates across these times without revealing the hypothesis upfront, maintaining blind conditions where possible.


## METRIC:

- **Engagement Rate**: Look for a significant increase over baseline levels compared with other time slots. Target an 80% confidence level.
   
   Example Metric:
    - Post Engagement at Midnight vs Control Time Slot (e.g., Midday): Should reach X engagement rate > Y%.

## DECISION RULE:

If the **Engagement Rate** of posts made exactly at midnight significantly exceeds that of control groups by more than a specified threshold, then we can conclude H2 holds true. If not significant beyond 80% confidence level (> X%), refute hypothesis.

Note: This is an idealized design and real-world factors like variations in audience behavior over days/times/wk could influence the results.

## Experiment Design

### HYPOTHESIS:
H1: Aggressive copy converts **20% better** than polite copy.

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
To test this hypothesis rigorously and determine if aggressive copies indeed convert 20% more effectively, we need the following data points:

- Number of clicks generated by both versions (aggressive vs. polite) for a statistically significant sample size.
- Conversion rates as percentages from these respective samples to compare effectiveness.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
To get an **80% confidence** level quickly and efficiently in this scenario, we should run A/B tests over 2 weeks on Google Ads or similar platforms that can show real-time conversion metrics. This allows us not only to gather a substantial amount of data but also offers immediate results.

### METRIC:
- Click-through rate (CTR) for both versions.
  
We will compare the CTRs directly, aiming at achieving an absolute difference indicative of 20% better performance by aggressive copy compared with polite copies:

```
Aggressive Copy’s expected conversion uplift = Polite Copy's observed CT ratio * 1.2
```

### DECISION RULE:
If Aggressive copy achieves a **CTR** that is approximately **+20% higher than the politeness-derived CTR**, we can conclude H1.

An example of applying this metric to real data would be:

- If polite copies have an average conversion rate (CTR) at 2%.
  
Then,
```
Aggressive Copy’s expected uplift = Polite Copy's observed CT ratio * 1.20
                                   = 0.02 * 1.20 
                                   = 24%
``` 

If Aggressive copy achieves a **Conversion Rate greater than or equal to** approximately `24%`, we can conclude H1 holds.
```

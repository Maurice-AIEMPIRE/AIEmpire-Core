# Rigorous Experiment Design

## Hypothesis:
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

## Evidence Required:

To test this hypothesis rigorously with the minimal evidence required for 80% confidence level, we need to collect data on two key metrics from a representative sample of both types ('How-to') and ('Why-to') posts. The necessary datapoints are:
1. Number of bookmarks per post.
2. Type of thread (either 'How-to' or 'Why-to').
3. Total views for each type.

## Fastest Experiment:

To achieve the smallest test duration with 80% confidence, we would need to analyze at least **30 posts** from both categories ('How-to' and 'Why-to'). This sample size is based on an assumption of normal distribution which helps us reach a faster conclusion about our hypothesis by achieving statistical significance for small datasets.

## Metric:

The metric that will be monitored closely in this experiment:
- Mean bookmarks per post (`mean_bookmarks`): Average number of times each thread ('How-to' and 'Why-to') is bookmarked.
  
Specifically, we are looking to see if `mean_bookmarks(H3)` > 2%, meaning the average bookmark count for a sample set exceeds two percent.

## Decision Rule:

If **the mean bookmarks per post in how-to threads exceed those of why-to posts by more than 80% (i.e., mean bookamarks(How-To) / mean_bookmarks(Why-TO)) > 1.8**, then we can conclude that 'how-to' indeed gets significantly more bookmarks compared to 'why-to'.

```

This experiment design ensures a straightforward and efficient approach while maintaining scientific rigor.

# Experiment Design for Testing H3 Hypothesis

## 1. Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## 2. Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis effectively:
- **Number of Bookmarks per Thread Type (How-to vs Why-to):**
  - Number of how-to posts.
  - Total number of how-to post bookmarks received over a specific period.

- **User Engagement Data:**
  - Average time spent on the threads by users who bookmark them.
  
## 3. Fastest Experiment
**Fastest Test to Get ~80% Confidence:** 
Run an A/B test for one month across different platforms (e.g., Stack Exchange, Reddit).
1. Randomly assign new 'How-to' and 'Why-to' posts into two groups:
   - Group H: New How-To Posts.
   - Group W: New Why-To Posts.

2. Track the number of bookmarks each post receives over one month for both types across different platforms to gather sufficient data within this period without waiting too long, aiming at achieving around 80% confidence in our results given random variation and engagement levels typically observed on such forums/content sites.
   
## 4. Metric
**Metric:** Number of Bookmarks per Post Type (How-to vs Why-to)
- Target: Achieve a statistically significant difference where the average number of bookmarks for How-to posts is significantly higher than that for Why-To posts.

## 5. Decision Rule
If:
1. The mean bookmark count for Group H > Mean Bookmark Count for Group W.
2. A t-test (independent samples) shows p-value < 0.05, indicating statistical significance at the desired confidence level (~80%).

**THEN:**
Conclude that 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

# Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS
Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Conversion rates (e.g., clicks-to-convert ratio) for both aggressive and polite copies on the same landing page or campaign.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Use A/B testing to measure conversion rate differences between two versions of a call-to-action: one using an aggressive tone ("Buy now! Limited time offer!") vs. another with politeness (e.g., "Would you like to buy this item? Hurry, limited availability").

- Control Group: Polite copy.
- Test Group 1: Aggressive copy.

Run the experiment for at least a few days until there is enough data collected in both groups that allows us to confidently measure differences between them. Ideally run multiple A/B tests across different audience segments and channels (if possible) as well, but keep these initial runs simple so we can get preliminary results quickly before scaling up experiments.

## METRIC
The primary metric will be the conversion rate difference: aggressive copy vs polite copy.
Aiming for a minimum 80% confidence interval on this observed improvement. We would like to see at least an estimated increase of +20% in conversions from using one version over another, with no significant drop (< -10%) when switching.

## DECISION RULE
If the conversion rate difference between aggressive and polite copy is statistically significantly positive by more than 5%, then we'll conclude that we can confidently say "aggressive copy converts better."

### Note: 
For this experiment to be valid for making a real-world decision, it's crucial not just look at whether there was an increase or decrease in conversions but also ensure the results are significant enough and statistically reliable. We want confidence levels above 80%, with strong evidence that observed changes were caused by variations between copy versions themselves rather than chance fluctuations.

### Caveats
1. Be wary of potential confounding variables, like audience differences across groups.
2. Make sure not to go too far overboard on aggressiveness: overly aggressive or misleading copies could harm your brand image and long-term customer relationships - this experiment shouldn't encourage such practices if it's proven successful in short term results.

### Potential Extensions
- Test additional copy variations (e.g., mixed tone) against the control.
- Analyze conversion rates across different audience segments to see who benefits most from each type of writing style.

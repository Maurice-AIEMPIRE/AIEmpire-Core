## Hypothesis
H1: Direct Mailers with 'Value First' value proposition get three times more replies than those without it.

---

### Evidence Required
- **Total number of direct mail pieces** sent to a random sample population that includes both DMs ("Direct Mail") and non-DMs (other types of marketing materials).
  
  - Number A: Total DM samples containing 'Value First' value proposition.
  - Number B: Total other type promotional material samples.

---

### Fastest Experiment
- We need the smallest test to get an **80% confidence level**. The sample size can be approximated using a binomial proportion formula for calculating margin of error with proportions:

* Margin Of Error = (z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n))/100

where:
  - z is the chosen significance threshold,
  - p is estimated probability, and
  - n is an estimate of sample size.

- With all this knowledge in mind we can now approximate our needed number by using a margin error value close to zero (for example: +/-.01 or +/- .005 for precision).

### Metric

We need the exact response rate percentage. We would compare DMs with 'Value First' against other promotional materials and calculate their respective reply rates:

- DM 1 sample size = Number A
- Non-DM Sample Size = Number B
  
Response Rate Percentages:
- Response Rate for DMs containing value proposition (Number of replies divided by total number received)
- Other types non-DM promo material's response rate

---

### Decision Rule

If the **DM 'Value First'** samples have a higher percentage than other promotional materials, then we consider our hypothesis confirmed. If not, this disproves H1.

*Note: A statistically significant difference is determined using confidence intervals.*

#### Confidence Interval
We would use 95% or another chosen threshold to calculate if there was statistical significance between the response rates of DMs with 'Value First' vs other non-DM promotional materials.

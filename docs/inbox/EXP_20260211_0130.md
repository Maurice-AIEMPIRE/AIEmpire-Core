# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
"Agrogressive copy converts better than polite copy."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

- Conversion rates (e.g., click-through rate or conversion percentage) of aggressive vs. polite copies.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Randomly select 50 email recipients.
2. Split them into two groups: Group A receives the aggressive copy and Group B gets the polite copy, ensuring each group has an equal number at least (e.g., both receive emails from exactly half of their total population).
3. Track conversion rates for a fixed period.

### METRIC:

- Conversion rate difference must be 20% greater in favor of one type compared to another.
  
### DECISION RULE:
If the observed change is statistically significant and equals or exceeds +/−10%, we can conclude that aggressive copy converts better than polite ones at an confidence level higher than (e.g., >80%).

Note: These metrics are hypothetical for this example. Always consult a statistician when designing real experiments to ensure statistical significance.

The experiment aims not only to test the hypothesis but also identify if there is any statistically significant difference in conversion rates between aggressive and polite copies of emails, with an expected power level that would give us over 80% confidence (statistical term used for deciding whether or not a given result can be explained by chance alone).

## Experiment Timeline:

The timeline required to complete this experiment depends on various factors. However, since the fastest design is being aimed at achieving results quickly and safely in mind, we will assume that it takes about 1 week.

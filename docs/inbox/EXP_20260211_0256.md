# Experimental Design for Testing Meme Virality Hypothesis

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
"Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

**H4:** Memes containing specific types of code (e.g., JavaScript) are shared more frequently and reach a larger audience in less time compared to memes without any coding elements.

---

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED

To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points:

- **Share Count Data:**
    - Number of shares on social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) for each meme.
    
- **Engagement Metrics:**
    - Likes
    - Comments
    
- **Time to Virality:**
    - Time taken from posting until reaching a specified virality threshold (e.g., 1K views).
    
- **Meme Type Classification:**
    - Categorization of memes into those containing code snippets and others not.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT

**Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence**

Create two sets:
- Set A contains at least `N` randomly chosen meme images with embedded JavaScript/code snippets that are already trending or have a known audience (e.g., GitHub Gists, Stack Overflow).
- Set B consists of similar memes without any code content but matched for other variables like humor level and image quality.

Measure the following over 1-week period:
- Daily shares.
- Engagement metrics daily until reaching at least `X` number of viral hits on each platform (e.g., trending status).

## 4. METRIC

**Exact Number to Watch:**

- **Daily Share Increase Rate:** Calculate and compare mean rates for Set A vs. Set B memes.

Example Threshold:
- If the average daily increase in shares per meme from both sets surpasses a predefined baseline by at least `80%` within one week, it can be considered as evidence that code-snippet memes go viral faster.

## 5. DECISION RULE

**If X (Share Count Increase Rate > Baseline), then Y (Meme with Code Snippets Go Viral Faster)**.

- **X:** Average daily shares for Set A surpass baseline by at least `80%`.
- **Y:** Memes containing code snippets are confirmed to go viral faster based on the observed metrics compared against non-code memes in set B.

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3 ("How-to" threads get more bookmarks than "Why-to").

- **Clear Hypothesis:** The number of bookmark clicks for 'How-to' threads is greater compared to the same period's average in a given time frame.

- **Evidence Required:**
  - Average Number of Bookmarks per Thread Type ('How-to', 'Why-to').
  - Time Period Data (e.g., over one week, across multiple days).
  - Total Threads for Each Category.
  - User Engagement Metrics on the respective threads to normalize data based on user interaction.

- **FASTEST EXPERIMENT:**
  - Select a high-volume forum or website with active 'How-to' and 'Why-to' thread sections (e.g., Reddit, Stack Exchange).
  - Randomly sample at least one week's worth of daily posts in each category for sufficient variability.
  - Analyze the total bookmarks across these sampled threads.

- **METRIC:**
  - Average Number of Bookmarks per Thread Type:
    - 'How-to' Threads Bookmark Count (HBC)
    - 'Why-to' Threads Bookmark Count (WTC)

- **Decision Rule:** 
  If HBC > WTC by a statistically significant margin after normalizing for user interaction, then confirm that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than average. A statistical significance threshold set at alpha = .05 will be used.

## Steps:

1. Identify or create data points from existing platforms:
   - Randomly sample thread counts and bookmark clicks per day over a specified period.
2. Normalize the number of interactions based on total user activity to control for varying levels of site engagement during different periods (e.g., peak vs off-peak hours).
3. Compare average bookmarks clicked in 'How-to' threads against those linked with similar active times ('Why-to').

4. Collecting sufficient sample size data is crucial:
   - At least 100 samples per category to reach an acceptable confidence level.
5. Statistical Analysis Methodology (e.g., t-test):
    To compare HBC and WTC, a paired-sample T-Test will be conducted because the same users are likely engaging with both types of threads.

6. Reporting Outcome:
   - If p-value < .05 for our statistical test comparing bookmarks between thread categories after normalization.
     Then we conclude that "How-to" threads statistically get more bookmark clicks than average compared to 'Why-to' during this period, confirming H3 as true under these conditions with a confidence level above 80%.

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis on Copy Conversion Rates

## HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To test this hypothesis rigorously:

- **Conversion Rate of Polite Copy (CR_politic)** - The percentage improvement achieved by the aggressive copy compared to a baseline.
- **Conversion Rate of Aggressive Copy (CR_aggressive)** - This will be measured over an identical sample size and conditions as polite copies.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A small-scale test can still provide 80% confidence if we correctly design it. 

1. Select two groups from the target audience that are demographically similar.
2. Ensure both versions of copy (polite vs aggressive) reach equal numbers, ideally using A/B testing platforms for accuracy.

### Group Size Considerations:
- Assuming a baseline conversion rate to start with is unknown; however, let's assume it’s 5% as an initial guess based on industry standards or previous experiments.
  
To achieve statistical significance at the desired confidence level (80%), sample sizes can be calculated using standard formulas. For simplicity:

**Group A: Polite Copy**
- Number of samples = N_politic
- Conversion rate observed with polite copy, denoted as CR_politic

**Group B: Aggressive Copy**
- Number of samples = N_aggressive (same number to ensure comparable conditions)
- Conversion rate achieved by aggressive copies should be at least 20% better than the baseline + politican conversion.

## METRIC
The metric we will closely monitor is:
  
- **CR_Aggressive / CR_Politic** ratio. We need this result specifically greater or equal to (1+0.2) = 1.2

We also want an observed difference significant enough at a confidence level of approximately ±8%.

## DECISION RULE
Based on the calculated sample size:
- If **CR_Aggressive > CR_Politic + baseline x 20%**, then we conclude H1 ("Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.") is supported.
- Otherwise, reject H1.

### Example Decision Rule (simplified for clarity):
**If X = Conversion Rate of Aggressive Copy - Baseline * 0.2 > Y = Conversion Rate Difference observed between Polite and baseline copies**, then accept hypothesis that aggressive copy converts more effectively than polite by at least the benchmarked difference rate.

## Implementation Steps
1. Choose sample sizes through power analysis to achieve desired confidence levels.
2. Randomly divide audience into two groups (equal number of users for A/B testing).
3. Apply both versions in an identical environment and track conversion rates over a defined period with proper controls implemented against external variables influencing results (e.g., seasonality effects, demographic biases).

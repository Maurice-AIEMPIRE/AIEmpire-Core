# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis H2

## HYPOTHESIS
"Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. **Engagement Metrics**:
   - Number of likes,
   - Comments received, and 
   - Shares posted by the post.
   
2. **Demographics Data:**
   - User location (US West Coasts),
   - Time stamps when posts are viewed/liked/comments/shares made.

3. **Posting Times Comparison:**
   - Engagement metrics for 2 AM postings vs other times of day,
   - Day-wise comparison to understand the trend and variability across different weekdays.
   
4. **Engagement Rate (ER):** Percentage increase in engagement at post time compared with baseline engagements from similar content posted outside peak hours.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- Select a sample size that statistically represents user interaction on social media platforms popular among US West Coast engineers, e.g., LinkedIn and Twitter.
- Post multiple identical pieces of engineering-related content simultaneously (including non-engineering related posts) at different times to establish baseline engagement rates outside 2 AM window.

## METRIC
- Engagement Rate (ER): ER > 0.5%, indicating a noticeable increase in engagements for the targeted time slot compared with other periods.
  
    Example: CTR = Click-through rate from likes/comments/shares of social media posts at specific times versus non-targeted slots, should exceed baseline by over 50%.

## DECISION RULE
If engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) posted during 2 AM on US West Coast platforms are **X% higher** than the average engagements for similar content outside this time slot and show consistent patterns across multiple trials (>80%), then H2 ("Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coasts engineers.") is supported.

### Example Decision Rule:
- If engagement rate (ER) of posts made during 2 AM > ER baseline by X% (e.g., x>50%, implying an increase greater than half the average),
- Then, "H2" holds true.

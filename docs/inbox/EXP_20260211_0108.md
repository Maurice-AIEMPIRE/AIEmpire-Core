# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H4"

## HYPOTHESIS:
Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of shares across social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, Instagram).
2. Time taken to reach a certain level of virality.
3. Engagement metrics such as likes and comments per share/shard.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Create two identical meme templates with slight variations: one containing code snippets embedded within the image or text captions; another without any code content but matching in terms of humor, relatability, etc., to ensure only differences are observed due to varying memes' virality. Share them simultaneously on a controlled set-up across various social media platforms and measure their spread.

## METRIC:
- The primary metric will be the increase rate (percentage) of shares over time for both meme types.
  
## DECISION RULE:

- If "Memes with code snippets have at least X% more shares than memes without within Y hours," then conclude that they go viral faster.


This design aims to provide a direct, controlled comparison under similar conditions. The smallest test ensuring 80% confidence would involve sharing the first set of meme pairs across platforms and observing for an initial peak in virality (shares). Monitoring should continue until statistically significant differences appear or resources run out.

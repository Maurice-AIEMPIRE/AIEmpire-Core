# EXPERIMENT DESIGN

```markdown
1. **HYPOTHESIS:** H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' threads.

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED:** 
   - Number of bookmark clicks on a sample set of how-to and why-to threads over the same period (e.g., one week).
   - Total views for both types to normalize bookmarking behavior.
   
3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT:**
   - Select 20 'How-to' posts randomly from different domains with similar engagement levels as control samples, alongside another set of 20 matched by total view count but categorized under why-to threads.

4. **METRIC:** 
   - Average bookmark clicks per thread divided by the number of views for both how-to and why-to types (bookmark click-through rate normalized to viewers).

5. **DECISION RULE:**
    If H3, then "Bookmarking behavior is significantly higher in 'How-to' threads compared with matched view counts on similar domains."

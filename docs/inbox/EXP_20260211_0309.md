# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS
**H0:** DMs with 'Value First' do not get three times more replies than those without it.

**Ha:** DM's that contain the phrase "Value First" receive 3x as many responses compared to others (no mention of Value).

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED: 

- A set of Direct Messages containing a variation in their content; some with 'Value First' and others not.
- The number count for each type - those including ‘ValueFirst’ vs. the rest.

* Alternatively, you can randomly select DM's to compare results between them without differentiating on whether they have V-F included or excluded (only 1 variable).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

Randomly create approximately 100 DMs that contain 'value first' and another set of roughly equal number containing a different phrase. 

**Reason:** To keep the sample size manageable while still capturing sufficient data to test our hypothesis.

*Note: We are aiming for an experiment quick enough in duration (days) but long-enough (weeks/months).*

## METRIC:

- Count how many DMs contain 'ValueFirst' and compare it against other messages that don't.
  
  > Note this is a preliminary metric. The real goal of the study should be to see if there's an increase/decrease in replies for V-F vs others.

*Note: We are assuming reply counts as our primary measure.*

## DECISION RULE:

- If Replies received by DMs with 'ValueFirst' exceed three times that amount (or 80% confidence) from those without it, we can conclude H0 is false and Ha holds true. Otherwise we'll need to conduct further experimentation.

*Note: We are assuming replies as our primary measure.*

**Additional Note:** The experiment design assumes a simple cause-effect relationship between DMs containing 'ValueFirst' vs others (no V-F). Other variables may also influence the number of responses received, such as time sent or other factors. 

## Alternative Approach:

If we need to test if DM's with an increased presence/visibility in social media posts generates 3x more replies: A/B testing a sample size would be appropriate - half randomly assigned one set (A) while another receives the variant (B). The results should indicate whether either is significantly better than others.

**Note:** We assume this experiment can take place over several weeks/months for sufficient duration to capture data points. 

## Further Notes: 

* A more robust design would involve testing across different social media platforms or DMs containing similar phrases.
* Randomization helps reduce bias and increase the validity of conclusions drawn from our results.

**Note:** This is a high-level experimental blueprint outlining how we might test this hypothesis, but further refinement can be made based on additional data points collected.

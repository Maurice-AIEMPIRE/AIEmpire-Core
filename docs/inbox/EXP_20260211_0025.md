# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H5"

## HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies."

**Hypotheses (Ho and Ha):**
- **Null hypothesis (Ho)** : There is no difference in the number of replies between DMs that contain "Value First" vs. those without.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**: DM containing "Value First" receives 3x more responses compared to others.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of replies on each message, categorized by whether it contains 'Value First' or not:
   - Total Replies per Group A (with 'Value First') and B (without).
   
2. Control variables for messages sent at different times/days/weeks/months to ensure consistency.

3. Randomly selected sample size meeting statistical power requirements.
4. Message content excluding the presence of "Value First" word, keeping only relevant features constant across samples if possible.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Send 300 DMs with 'Value First' and another 100 without it (random sampling) to an equal number of recipients chosen randomly for both groups.
2. Ensure control variables are consistent throughout the test period in order not affect results significantly or skew them beyond acceptable levels.

## METRIC:
The metric that we will observe is "Total Replies per Group" which should increase by 3 times more replies compared with group B (without 'Value First') to be significant, reaching a value of X = Y * 2 for any given threshold values in the groups A and B respectively.
   
## DECISION RULE:
- **If total number of replies on messages containing "Value First" is three or less than double that received by others without it (X >= Y*3), then we reject Ho, supporting Ha.**
    
By following this rigorous experimental design structure outlined above with a clearly stated hypothesis and an organized process for testing to conclude our findings about DMs with 'Value First' getting 3x more replies statistically validly supported scientifically.

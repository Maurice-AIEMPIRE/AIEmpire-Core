## HYPOTHESIS:
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of clicks indicating interest (i.e., bookmark counts).
2. The ratio or proportion of bookmarked posts in each category ('How-to', and 'Why-to').

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
We need at least 1000 'How-to' threads and an equal number, ideally randomly sampled from the platform to avoid sampling bias.
1. Randomly select a statistically significant sample size (e.g., n=300) of both categories ('How-to', and 'Why-to') ensuring they are comparable in terms of time posted or visibility.

## METRIC:
Exact Number: Total bookmarks per 100 posts for each category ("Bookmark Rate" = Bookmarks / Posts * 100)

## DECISION RULE:
- If the Bookmark rate difference between "How-to" threads (H) and "Why-to" Threads (W) is > X% with Y confidence level, we conclude H3.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get triple the replies compared to DMs without it."

1. **HYPOTHESIS:** DM messages containing "Value First" receive 3 times more responses than those that do not contain this phrase.

2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED:**
    - Number of incoming emails for each type (with and without 'Value First').
    
## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
### Smallest test to get an approximate confidence level:
- Randomly select two small groups from a larger pool, ensuring they are demographically similar.
  - Group A with "Value First" in the DM subject line or body message. 
  - Group B without using 'Value First'.
  
## METRIC TO WATCH
Exact number: Percentage increase of replies for DMs containing “Value First” compared to those that do not.

**80% confidence level threshold:** Increase by at least double (i.e., a minimum observed improvement in response rate should be more than 2 times the baseline).

3. **METRIC**
- Number and percentage increase of responses.
  
4. **DECISION RULE: IF 'Value First' included, THEN expect X number or % Y higher replies compared to without it.

**Example Metric:** If Group A gets x% response rate vs group B with y%, then we can conclude that the inclusion of "Value First" results in a significant increase (X > 2y) if X ≥ double Y.

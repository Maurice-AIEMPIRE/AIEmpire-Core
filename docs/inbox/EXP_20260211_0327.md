## Hypothesis
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts **20% better than polite copy**

---

### Evidence Required:
- Conversion rates of both aggressive and polite copies over the same time period.

### Fastest Experiment to Get 80% Confidence:

#### Sample Size Calculation for a Two-Sample Proportion Test (Z-Test):
To achieve an 80% confidence level, we can use Z-test formulas. Generally speaking,
\[ n = \left( \frac{z^2 * p * (1-p)}{d^2} \right) + k \]

Where:
- \( z = 1.28\ for a one-sided test at an 80% confidence level.
- \(p=0.5\, as \, the best-case scenario to maximize sample size required
- d is desired margin of error (convertibility improvement)

However,
let's assume we have prior data or benchmarks; let's say:

Initial conversion rate = X%
Desired increase for aggressive copy = 20% more than polite

Let:
\( p_{aggressive} \)=X+0.2*X=1.2X
\(p_polite\)=X%

Then margin of difference (d) is: 
\[ d=\left| P(politic)-P( Aggressive )\right|\ = X - 1.2X=-0.2X\, for desired improvement

Given this, let's calculate sample size assuming worst case scenario; i.e., max conversion rate.

Using formula:

#### Calculation (for simplicity): 
\[ n= \left(\frac{z^2 * P( Aggressive )*P(Polite)} {d^{ 2}}\right)+k
\]

\(n = z^2 *( X)(1-X) / d ^2 + k

To maximize confidence, let’s assume: \(X\)=0.5 (50% baseline)
\[ n= \left(\frac{(1.28)^2 * (.5* .5)} {( - 20%.of.x )^{ 2}}\right)+k

Let margin of error tolerance = d= X- P(Aggressive)

If:
X=.5,
P(Aggressive)=0.6 (60%)
d=(50%-60%)=-10%,

Then let’s simplify assuming worst-case scenario:

Assume k small to minimize sample size.
Using formula
\[ n=\left(\frac{(1.28)^2 * (.25)} {(- 20%. of x)^{ 2}}\right)
= \approx (4*0.32)/x^2 =128/X^2
if X=.5 we get ~256 as minimum sample size needed 

Note: The exact calculation needs further numerical approximation to reach desired confidence.

#### Deciding Rule:
**If P( Aggressive ) - P(Polite) > 20%, then H1 holds true.**

---

### Metric:

- **Conversion Rate Difference (CDR):**
\[ CDR = \left(\frac{Conversions(Aggressive)- Conversions(polite)} {Total visitors for each copy}\right)\]

**Target: Conversion improvement of at least +10% (+2 times baseline) as compared to polite conversion**

---

### Decision Rule:

If the observed difference in **conversion rates (CDR)** between aggressive and politie copies is more than 20%, we reject H0, supporting our hypothesis that Aggressive copy converts better by approximately X%.

**Note:** Exact statistical metrics like confidence interval can further validate experimental results. 

This setup allows for testing with minimal sample size to achieve a reasonable level of evidence quickly but iteratively refine data collection and validation.

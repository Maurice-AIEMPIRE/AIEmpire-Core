## Hypothesis Testing Experiment for H2

### 1. Hypothesis:
**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

### 2. Evidence Required:

To test this hypothesis rigorously and gather sufficient data points, we need the following evidence/data collected over a specified period of time from social media platforms where our target audience (US West Coast Engineers) is active: 

- Timestamped posts with their respective engagement metrics.
- Geolocation information to confirm US West Coast origin for both posters and viewers.

### 3. Fastest Experiment:

**Setup:** Post an identical promotional content at exactly 2 AM Eastern Time on a given day, targeting audiences based in the United States (specifically using social media ads targeted towards engineers). Repeat this posting daily over one week to gather initial data quickly within seven days for preliminary insights.

### 4. Metric:
The primary metric will be Click-Through Rate (CTR) specifically from posts made at exactly 2 AM Eastern Time:

**Metric:** CTR > X% 

Where 'X' represents the baseline engagement rate determined by analyzing historical post-performance metrics during different times of day and days of week over a longer period.

### 5. Decision Rule:
If **Post-Capture Rate (PCR)** observed from posts made at exactly 2 AM Eastern Time is significantly higher than our established threshold for X%, then H2 can be considered valid with an acceptable level of statistical confidence, otherwise we reject the hypothesis.

# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H0 (Null): DMs with 'Value First' do not get significantly more replies compared to other messages.

Ha (Alternative): DM's that include the phrase "Value First" receive 3 times as many responses on average than those without it, after adjusting for confounding variables such as time of day and message length.


## Evidence Required

1. Count number of DMs sent with 'Value First' in a controlled sample.
2. Measure corresponding replies to these messages (response count).
3. Collect similar data from matched control group not using the phrase "Value First" under equivalent conditions regarding timing, content without promotional language etc.

4. Track and compare both response rates over time for accurate comparisons.


## Fastest Experiment

* Run a pilot study with 100 DM's sent - 50 containing 'Value First' (Experimental) vs. another 50 serving as control messages.
1. Randomly select the times of day to send these DMs, ensuring no significant seasonal variations in response rates.

2. Monitor for replies within an hour.


## Metric

- Achieve a statistically significantly higher average number of responses per DM containing 'Value First' compared with non-promotional texts after adjusting for confounding variables (like time-of-day and message length).


## Decision Rule

* If the experimental DMs receive 3 times as many answers on average than control messages, then accept Ha; otherwise reject H0.

# Experimental Design for Testing H1

## Hypothesis
H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

## Evidence Required 
To test this hypothesis effectively:
- Conversion rates (percentage of users who click on a link or make some form of desired action) from aggressive copies versus polite copies.
  
**Data Points Needed**
1. Number of impressions for both aggressive and polite versions.
2. Click-through rate (CTR) to measure conversion success.

## Fastest Experiment
To achieve 80% confidence with the smallest test:
- Conduct an A/B testing campaign where you show equal numbers of users either version over a short period, e.g., one week on popular websites or social media platforms like Facebook ads.
  
**Sample Size Calculation**
Using power analysis for comparing two means (aggressive vs. polite), assuming normal distribution and aiming to achieve 80% confidence level:
- t-test with desired effect size of at least 20%.
  
Let’s assume using the following parameters: 
1. Alpha = 0.05
2. Power = 0.8

Using a power analysis tool or table, we can determine an appropriate sample size.

## Metric to Watch (Exact Number)
- Target CTR for aggressive copy vs polite copy.
    - Aggressive Copy:
      - Baseline expectation: Assume baseline conversion rate is X%.
      - H1 Goal: At least 20% better than the politeness level. Thus, target = X + Y%, where Y >= 20%.

## Decision Rule
- If Average CTR for aggressive copies > (Average CTR of polite copy) * 1.2 then accept hypothesis.
  
Example:
If baseline conversion rate is observed at 5%, with an acceptable variation due to random factors or noise,
the target will be: Baseline + 0.20 = 6%.
Thus, decision rule becomes:

**Decision Rule**
- If Average CTR for aggressive copies > Conservative Lower Bound of polite copy by more than the specified margin (e.g., conservative lower bound observed at X% with a reasonable standard deviation), then accept H1.

Example Decision Table
| Aggressive Copy Mean Conversion Rate | Polite Copy Mean Conversion Rate |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 7.0%                                  | Baseline = 5%, Conservative Lower Bound calculated as (Politeness observed baseline) * conservative margin |

Thus, if aggressive copy conversion rate consistently shows better performance with statistical significance:
- Decision to accept H1 is made.

The actual experiment would consist of running the campaign for a sufficient amount time while monitoring conversions daily. Final results should be analyzed using appropriate statistics such as t-tests and confidence intervals after collecting enough data points (sample size calculated above).

Note: Realistic experiments need continuous adjustment based on observed trends during initial stages to ensure robust, unbiased outcomes.

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies compared to other types of direct messages.

---

### Evidence Required
- Number of responses received on DM threads that include the term "Value First" (variable A).
- Total number of these specific DM threads created and tracked over a given time period.
  
  **E.g.:** If 'Value First' DMs are posted across various platforms or social networks.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A quick test could involve setting up three identical groups on the same platform (like Instagram, Facebook Messenger):
- Group A: Send out DM threads mentioning "Value First" to a randomly chosen sample of 100 users.
- Group B: Send regular DMs without any specific mention or value proposition for another set of 100 different random user samples. Track responses over one week.

*Assume the platform's sampling size allows each group interaction with up to an equal number of distinct individuals.*

---

### Metric
**METRIC:** Number of replies per DM thread mentioning 'Value First'. To calculate if it's three times more, we are interested in whether A (Number of Replies for DMs including "Value First") is greater than 3 * B (Average Responses from Non-'Value-First' DMs).

---

### Decision Rule
**DECISION RULE:** If the average number of replies per DM thread mentioning 'Value First' significantly exceeds three times that metric, then we can reject our null hypothesis. For example:

If A > X + Y/3 where:
  - **X = Average Responses from Non-'Value-First' DMs (B)**
  - **Y = Total number of responses for all DM threads**

Then HYPOTHESIS is supported; otherwise, it isn't.

### Notes
*This test assumes that there are no significant differences in the behavior or demographics between users receiving 'Value First'-DMs and those who don't. Additional controls may be needed to ensure validity.*

## HYPOTHESIS
H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED 
We need two sets of data for aggressive and polite copies:
- Conversion rates (percentage) from each type. More precisely, the total number of clicks resulting in a conversion divided by the overall views or impressions received.
  
## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To achieve 80% confidence with minimal testing time:

1. Prepare both an Aggressive copy variant (ACV) and a Polite Copy Variant (PCV).
2. Randomly split incoming traffic into two groups: One group sees ACVs, the other PCVs.

A small sample size is needed due to limited resources:
- Assume each conversion increases our confidence level by 1%.

## METRIC
We need exact number observation for Conversion Rate.
Example Metric = Number of conversions / Total impressions (clicks)

Let's say we want a minimum difference in conversion rates between ACV and PCV.

Minimum required improvement: Aggressive copy needs to convert **at least 20% better** than polite one as per H1 hypothesis. For instance, if the baseline politeness rate is X%, aggressive must be at least (X + 0.2*X)%.
  
## DECISION RULE
If conversion rates of ACVs are consistently higher by a margin that supports our metric criteria - then we confirm:
- Y: Aggressive copy converts better than polite.

In simpler terms, if the observed difference in conversions between aggressive and politeness is at least 20%, we'll accept H1 as true.

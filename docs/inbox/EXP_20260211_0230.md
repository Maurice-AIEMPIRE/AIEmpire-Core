# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
Memes containing code snippets spread virally at a significantly higher rate compared to memes without any embedded codes.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED

- Total number of posts (memes) created by both groups:
    - Group A: Memes with code snippets.
    - Group B: Mememes without encoded snippet.
  
- Number and nature of reactions/comments per post in each group over time to track engagement rates.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT

Create a sample dataset that includes:

1. **Group Creation**:
   - Generate meme templates for both groups A (with code snippets) and B (without).
   
2. **Posting Mechanism**:
   - Utilize social media platforms or forums to post memes at the same times with equal visibility.

3. **Tracking Engagements Over Time:**
    - Track posts using a tool that records reactions/comments over 24 hours.
  
4. **Sample Size Determination (80% Confidence)**:
     Use power analysis tools like G*Power, assuming moderate effect size and alpha level of .05 to determine the minimum sample sizes for each group.

## 4. METRIC

- Engagement Rate: Number of interactions per post divided by total posts over a specified time frame.
  
- Virality Index (VI): Average increase in interaction rate after initial posting compared with expected viral spread pattern metrics from historical meme data without code snippets:
    - Group A (> X% higher VI than baseline).
    - Group B (< Y% lower/zero change).

## 5. DECISION RULE

If the average engagement for memes containing codes exceeds that of non-code memes by at least *X %* after a standard observation period (e.g., one week), then we conclude H4 is supported.

**Note:** Adjust X and Y based on historical data benchmarks to calibrate expectations accurately.

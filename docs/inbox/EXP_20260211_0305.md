# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
- **H1**: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
We need data points that measure conversions (clicks) resulting from different types of email subject lines. Specifically, we will compare two groups based on their content:

1. Group A – Polite Copy Subject Lines.
2. Group B – Aggressive Copy Subject Lines.

Each group should have a sufficiently large sample size to ensure statistical significance and reliable results for calculating confidence intervals (CI).

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
The fastest experiment would consist of sending two sets of emails with polite vs aggressive copy subject lines over the same period, aiming at achieving 80% CI. We need:

1. A baseline conversion rate from previous campaigns or an initial sample size to determine required email volume.
2. Split testing where half (or ideally more) recipients receive one type and others get a different.

### METRIC:
We will measure conversions directly through click-through rates (CTR), which is the percentage of people who clicked on our links in emails divided by total number of messages delivered, expressed as a percentage:

- **METRIC TO WATCH**: CTR > 2% for both types.
  
Additional metrics may also be relevant such as open rate and bounce rate.

### DECISION RULE:
The hypothesis will hold if the following conditions are met after analyzing results (considering an alpha level of 0.05):

1. If Group B’s average conversion count significantly exceeds that from Group A with a confidence interval around our mean differences.
2. The observed difference between Groups must be statistically significant to reject null hypotheses at least for one-tailed tests.

Using software tools like Python, R or even Excel can help streamline the data analysis process and confirm if aggressive copy performs better than polite subject lines as per H1 hypothesis testing criteria in statistical significance levels (p-value < 0.05).

### Summary:
We aim to measure conversion rates based on different types of email content using two groups split for comparison, achieving an efficient experimental design that is statistically robust enough with minimal sample size requirements and clear decision rules.

# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H1:** Posting at any time captures US West Coast engineers.

---

## Evidence Required:
- **Timestamped engagement logs (likes, comments) with timestamps of when posts are made.**
- **Geolocation data indicating the region where users engaged or commented on the post to confirm if they reside in the Pacific Time Zone (PST/PDT).**

---

## Fastest Experiment
1. Select a single engaging piece of content.
2. Post this at three different times: 12 AM, 4 PM, and 11 PM PST/PTZ over one week.

*Note:* Each post should be identical except for the time posted to isolate posting time as an independent variable from other factors such as day/night cycle or weekend effects.*

---

## Metric
- **Click-through rate (CTR):** We aim at achieving a CTR >2% with 80% confidence after running this test.

*Note:* The metric can also be adjusted based on the type of content and expected user engagement patterns for US West Coast engineers. Other metrics like conversion rates or interaction depth could provide additional insights depending upon specific goals.*

---

## Decision Rule
- **If CTR >2%, conclude that posting at any time captures interest from our target audience (US West Coast Engineers).**
  
*Note:* The confidence level should be determined through statistical analysis such as a binomial test, comparing observed engagement rates to expected baseline interaction levels. Adjust the sample size based on preliminary results and desired precision.*

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of shares on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit).
2. Engagement metrics including likes and comments per share/share post interaction within the first 24 hours.
3. Initial impressions or retweets/comments count in these respective time frames.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Create two sets of memes with similar themes but one set contains a code snippet relevant to its theme (e.g., coding humor, programming jokes) while another is without any codes. Post them on social media platforms using popular meme generators and track the metrics for 24 hours since posting time.

### METRIC:
The primary metric should be "Shares" as this directly correlates with virality.
- Target: MEMEs with code snippets to have a minimum of X shares in first 12 hours, Y% increase compared to memes without codes after initial impressions or retweets/comments count by the end of day one.

### DECISION RULE:
If memes with coded humor achieve at least X shares within their specified timeframe AND experience an above-average engagement rate (likes + comments) and share rates when contrasted against meme counterparts sans code snippets in first 24 hours, conclude that "memes containing codes go viral faster."

Note: These experiments should be conducted over a sufficient duration to account for variances across different days/times. This is done while keeping the subject content consistent as much possible (within memes' context/theme).

## HYPOTHESIS
"H2: Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. **Time of Post**:
   - Posts timestamped and categorized by time (e.g., 12 AM, 1 AM, ..., etc.).
   
2. **Geographical Location Data**:
   - IP addresses or geolocation data for posts to identify the location.
   - Focus on US West Coast engineers’ known locations.

3. **Engagement Metrics**: 
   - Likes
   - Shares
   - Comments

4. **Demographic Information (optional)** but useful if consent is obtained, such as:
   - Age range of participants who engage with posts at 2 AM.
   - Professional background confirmation to ensure they are engineers.

5. **Time Zone Confirmation**: 
   - Posts timestamped correctly accounting for the different time zones across US West Coast regions (California, Oregon).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Select a sample size of social media profiles representing known engineering communities and influencers in US West Coast.
2. Prepare 3 sets each containing posts made at:
    - Set A: Regular hours (~9 AM to ~5 PM)
    - Set B: Evening time (6 PM to midnight).
    - Set C: Targeted hour, which is **12 AM** or equivalently around the peak of US West Coast's local time zone.
   
3. Distribute posts across a 24-hour period covering all three sets equally but with specific emphasis on targeting times corresponding to Sets A and B.

4. Run this experiment over two weeks ensuring equal distribution for each set, maintaining consistency in content quality related only marginally (subjective).

## METRIC
- **Click-through rate (CTR)** specifically at the 2 AM posts compared against regular hour postings.
    - Target metric: CTR of Set C > 3% as baseline to determine effectiveness.

## DECISION RULE:
If the observed CTR for posting targeted content around US West Coast engineers' active hours is significantly higher than during other times, with confidence level above **80%**, we accept "H2" (posts at specific time captures interest from target audience).

### Steps
1. Record posts’ engagement metrics across different groups.
2. Compare results using statistical methods to calculate if observed CTR surpasses 3%.
3. Validate data consistency and randomness.

By executing this simple yet targeted experiment, one can efficiently test the hypothesis with a minimal sample size while ensuring robust evidence collection for accurate interpretation of trends associated specifically around US West Coast engineers' active hours on social platforms.

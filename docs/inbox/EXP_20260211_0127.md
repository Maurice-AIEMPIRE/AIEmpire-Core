# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## 1. HYPOTHESIS:
"H0 vs H1" states clearly as follows:

- **H0** (Null hypothesis): Aggressive copy does not convert better than polite copy; conversion rates are equal.

- **H1** (Alternative hypothesis): Aggressive copy converts at least 20% more effectively compared to polite copy.


## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
The experiment will require the following data points:

- Conversion rate for aggressive copies.
- Conversion rate for polite copies as a control group.






### Fastest Experiment

A small-scale test with minimal participants is needed, ideally under one month (to account for variations over time). This would involve launching parallel A/B tests on two similar segments of your audience to measure the conversion rates.


#### METRIC:

The primary metric we should be monitoring closely will not only include raw conversion percentages but also an 80% confidence interval around these estimates. Therefore, we're looking at a statistically significant difference between groups with this level of certainty.



## Decision Rule:
A precise decision rule based on our setup would look something like this:


- **If the observed improvement in conversions for aggressive copies is greater than or equal to (and significantly different from) 20% compared to polite copy conversion rates, then we will reject H0 and accept that there’s a significant difference favoring an increase of at least 20%.**



This setup ensures we're not only checking if there's any statistically detectable improvement but also confirming it's specifically in the range we've hypothesized (at least 20%).

## Hypothesis
**HYPOTHESIS:** Memes with code snippets go viral faster than memes without them.

## Evidence Required
1. **Number of shares and likes (engagement metrics):**
   - Total number of times the meme is shared across social media platforms within a given time frame.
   
2. **Time to reach peak virality:**
   - Time taken for each type of meme (with code snippets vs without) from posting until it reaches its maximum share count.

3. **Initial engagement rate before going viral:**
   - The number and quality of likes, shares comments within the first hour after being posted.
   
4. **Sentiment analysis score:** 
   - Sentiments expressed in user interactions (likes/shares/comments).

## Fastest Experiment
**FASTEST EXPERIMENT:** Create two sets of memes:
- Set A: Memes with embedded code snippets relevant to tech communities such as programming languages, software tools etc.
- Set B: Identical looking memes but without the included coding content.

Post both meme types on platforms like Reddit (r/programming), Twitter and Instagram at similar times over a 24-hour period. The experiment should target these two social media hubs due to their high traffic from tech-savvy users who may find code snippets appealing.
Use unique tracking links for each post that can measure shares, likes/comments in real-time.

## Metric
**METRIC:** Engagement rate (ER) defined as the total number of interactions divided by the initial posts. For memes with codes:
- ER > 2%

For regular memes without coding content: 
- ER < 1.5%

This metric ensures an observable and significant difference to establish viral potential.

## Decision Rule
**DECISION RULE:** If engagement rate (ER) for memes containing code snippets is consistently higher than the control group, then conclude that H4 ("Memes with codes go viral faster") holds true.

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- Conversion rate (number of clicks or actions taken divided by the number of impressions) from both aggressive and polite copies.
- Sample size needed to achieve statistically significant results.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. **Sample Selection**: Randomly select a sample group for each copy type, ensuring equal distribution across demographics like age range (18-35), gender split 50/50 balanced with no other demographic biases present beyond what is mentioned.
   
2. **Control Variables**:
   - Same landing page URL to prevent any traffic source discrepancies
   - Identical CTA buttons and design elements for both versions, except the copy text

3. **Test Duration (for achieving at least 80% confidence)**: Run A/B tests simultaneously over a minimum of one month.

4. **Data Points**:
    - Total number of impressions per variant.
    - Conversion rate from aggressive vs polite copies
      \[
        \text{Conversion Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Conversions}}{\text{Total Impressions}} \right) \times 100\%
      \]
5. **Statistical Significance**: Ensure that the sample size is calculated based on a power analysis to detect at least an 80% confidence level for differences in conversion rates with minimal variance.

### METRIC
- Conversion rate increase from aggressive copy compared to polite.
  
If \( CR_{Aggressive} - CR_{Polite} > \frac{20}{100} = 0.2\), then the hypothesis is supported by data.


### DECISION RULE:
1. Calculate initial conversion rates for both versions after a week-long trial period (to avoid any warming effects).
   
2. If \( CR_{Aggressive} - CR_{Polite}\) exceeds an expected mean increase of less than 0.20% with at least 80% confidence interval, proceed to the full month test.

3. During this extended testing phase:
    a. Monitor conversion rates daily.
    
    b. Apply Bayesian statistical models if necessary for continuous updating and analysis (considering priors like initial weekly data).

4. After one month's trial period: 
   - Compute final aggregated conversions per impression, split by aggressive vs polite copies.

5. Evaluate the hypothesis using:
\[
p-value < 0.05 \implies Hypothesis supported
\]
   
6. If after rigorous analysis for significant results are not obtained (i.e., \( p > 0.05 \)), consider revisiting sample size and other test parameters to ensure accurate testing conditions.

### Note: 
For ethical considerations, transparency with participants about the purpose of A/B tests should be maintained where feasible without compromising confidentiality or experimental integrity.

# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS:
**H1:** Posting at midnight captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### Evidence Required:

- Number of posts made exactly at Midnight (00:00 AM) on a given date and time across various social media platforms targeted to the tech community.
- User engagement data for those specific posts, including likes, shares, comments from users located in the Pacific Time Zone (US West Coast).
- The geolocation or timezone information available with user accounts engaging with these tweets/posts.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Select 5 popular social media platforms used by engineers.
2. Create and post a tweet/message about tech-related content at exactly midnight PST on Day X across all five chosen platforms simultaneously over one week (Monday to Sunday).
3. Tag the message as #TechTuesday (#MeToo, etc.), so it's visible without being time-sensitive in search results.

---

### METRIC:

- Engagement rate for each post specifically from users located within US West Coast timezone regions (> 2%).

---

### DECISION RULE: 

If engagement rates are greater than or equal to **2%**, then conclude that posting at midnight captures engineers on the US West Coast. If less, hypothesize H1 is incorrect.

Note:
- The experiment should run for multiple weeks with different time zones and days of week.
- Control posts without #TechTuesday hashtags posted after 12 AM PST during those same periods to account for general social media engagement versus specific hashtag-driven interaction patterns.
- Conduct the test in an automated fashion using tools that can post tweets/messages at specified times, track user engagements (like retweets/shares/comments), and verify geolocation.

---

**DISCLAIMER:**

Engagement metrics may vary due to numerous factors like trending topics outside of tech interests during those days/times. Engagement rates could also be influenced by other variables such as holidays or weekend effects on social media behavior patterns in the region being tested.

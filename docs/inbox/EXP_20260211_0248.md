# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H0: DMs with 'Value First' do not get significantly more replies than those without it.

Ha: DM messages containing the phrase "Value First" receive 3x as many responses compared to similar posts that don't contain this phrase. 

**Note:** The original hypothesis implies a comparison where one group receives three times (or nearly triple) fewer interactions when using 'Value First'. This seems contradictory, and there may be an error in how it's worded or understood.

## Evidence Required
We need the following data points:
1. Number of responses received for DMs with "Value First" included.
2. Number of responses to similar messages that don't contain this phrase ("Control Group").
3. Sample size (number) per group, ideally large enough for statistical significance but not too vast as we aim at a FASTEST EXPERIMENT.

## Fastest Experiment
To obtain an 80% confidence level quickly:
- Randomly select multiple DMs with "Value First" and similar posts without the phrase.
- Track responses over one week to ensure variability in response times is accounted for (e.g., weekdays vs weekends).

**Sample Size Calculation:**
An approximate sample size calculation can be done using a power analysis; however, given this aims at FAST experiments:
- Start with 50 messages containing "Value First" and another equivalent number without it.
  
## Metric
We will monitor the following metric for both groups (Control + Test Group):
1. Number of responses received per message.

**Statistical Tests:**
Use a Chi-squared test to compare if there is any significant difference between two proportions:
- Null Hypothesis (\(H0\)): No statistically meaningful relationship exists.
- Alternative hypothesis \(Ha): A significantly higher rate of replies (at least triple) for DMs with "Value First".

## Decision Rule
Based on our Metric and statistical significance level:

1. If Chi-squared test result shows a significant difference at the 5% confidence interval (\(\alpha = 0.05\)), we reject \(H_0\).
2. Interpret this as an indication that DMs containing "Value First" get significantly more replies.

**Note:** This experiment's design aims to quickly establish initial evidence for further study or refinement of hypothesis and methodology if the results warrant it (e.g., insufficient sample size, needing longer tracking duration). More robust studies can build upon these findings.

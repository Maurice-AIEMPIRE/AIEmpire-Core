# Experiment Design for Testing Meme Virality Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"Hypothesis being tested is that memes with code snippets go viral faster than those without."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED 
To test this hypothesis rigorously and ensure statistically significant results, the following data points are needed:

1. **Number of Shares:** How many times each meme has been shared on social media platforms.
2. **Engagement Metrics:**
   - Likes (L)
   - Comments (C)
   - Retweets/Repins (RT/RR) for different types of memes
3. **Time to Reach Milestones:**
   - Time taken from posting until first share, comment or retweet occurs (`T_first_share`)
4. **Duration Active:** How long the meme remains active in social media conversations.
5. **Sentiment Analysis Scores** (optional but helpful): Measure sentiment towards each shared/meme instance.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A small-scale experiment to gather initial evidence:

1. Prepare 10 memes with code snippets and another set of 10 without them, ensuring that the content quality is consistent across both sets.
2. Post these memes simultaneously on a controlled platform (e.g., Twitter) at different times but within short intervals for uniform exposure conditions.

**Time Frame:**
Post all selected meme images immediately after their creation to minimize time variance in virality measurement windows of up to 24 hours or the first day they appear active.
    
## METRIC
The exact number we need:

- **Engagement Rate (ER):** Average engagement per share for both memes with code snippets and those without. ER = (L + C + RT/RR) / Number of shares.

A significant increase in Engagement Rates (>20%) suggests that the hypothesis holds true, indicating faster virality due to inclusion of code snippet content.
    
## DECISION RULE
**If:** The average engagement rate for memes with a code snippets is greater than 1.2 times (ER_Codes > ER_NoCodes * 1.2)

**Then:** Conclude "Memes containing code snippets go viral faster."

This decision rule helps us identify if the presence of codes in meme content substantially increases virality compared to non-code variants.

## Execution Plan
- **Randomization and Control:**
    - Randomly select themes/content for memes.
    - Ensure consistent posting times on a chosen social media platform (e.g., Twitter) within 30 minutes but spaced at least an hour apart, across the days of observation period. 
- Monitor shares/engagement using Social Media Management tools like Hootsuite or SproutSocial to ensure accurate real-time data collection.
    
## Follow-up Experiment
Based on initial findings:
1. Increase sample size (e.g., double).
2. Introduce control variables such as meme length, visual appeal ratings from an audience subset before posting them broadly.

Continuously monitor for any new trends that emerge in viral content patterns and adjust the hypothesis accordingly to reflect ongoing insights into what drives rapid virality on social media platforms.

## Hypothesis
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis effectively, we need to collect and analyze the following data points:

1. **Thread Type:** Whether it is a "How-to" or "Why-to".
2. **Bookmark Count** for each thread within 24 hours of its creation.
3. Average Bookmark Rate (ABR) per hour/day across different threads.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
The fastest experiment to get an initial understanding would involve observing the first few hundred posts in both categories ("How-to" and "Why-to") over a span of one week after their posting time, with daily checks. This ensures we're capturing trends as they develop without waiting for long-term data collection.

---

### METRIC: Exact Number:
We should measure whether 'How-to' threads consistently have an average bookmark rate (ABR) that is statistically significantly higher than the ABR observed in "Why-to" posts by at least 10% within one week. 

Alternatively, we can set a specific target for confidence level:

- Target A: Average Bookmark Count per Thread.
  
---

### Decision Rule:
If 'How-to' threads have an average bookmark count that is statistically significantly higher than the ABR of "Why-to" posts (p-value < 0.05), then accept H3.

Otherwise, reject or fail to support H3 based on evidence collected during this experiment period.


Example formula for comparison can be:

`Bookmark Count per Thread / Total Number of 'How-to' Threads - Bookmark Count per Thread / Total Number of 'Why-to' Threads > X (with a confidence level at least 80%)`

Where `X = difference threshold to deem statistically significant.`

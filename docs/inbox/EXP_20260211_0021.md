# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS

## 1. Hypothesis:
**H5:** DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than those without.

## 2. Evidence Required:

- **Number of Messages (N)** that include the phrase "Value First" and a control group.
- The total number of responses received for each message in both groups, separated into:
    - Group A: DMs with 'Value First'.
    - Group B: Control DM without 'Value First'.

## 3. Fastest Experiment:

Create two sets (Group A & Group B) containing an equal sample size **(N)** messages which are randomized to avoid bias.

- Randomly select N = 300 Messages from your dataset, ensuring they include responses that can be clearly classified as positive or negative.
  
- Split the selected DMs evenly into:
    - Group A (DM with 'Value First')
    - Group B (Control DM without 'Value First')

Run this small experiment to get an initial idea of any differences in response rates.

## 4. Metric:

The key metric is **Response Rate Ratio**: The ratio between the average number of responses per message for DMs containing "Value First" and those that do not contain it.
  
Target Response Rate = (Average Responses per Message with 'Value First') / (Average Responses per Control DM without 'Value First')

Aim to achieve a clear-cut response rate difference. Specifically, we want:

\[ \text{Response Rate Ratio} > 3:1 \]

## 5. Decision Rule:
- If the **Response Rate Ratio** of DMs with "Value First" is greater than three times that for control DM (i.e., more than a ratio of 3 to 1), then H5 ("DMS with 'Value First' get 3x more replies.") holds true.
  
- Conversely, if this metric shows the response rate difference does not exceed or achieve triple effectiveness compared against DMs without "Value First", reject Hypothesis (H5).

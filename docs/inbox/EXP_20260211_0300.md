# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
**H0 (Null Hypothesis): Posting content does not capture a higher engagement rate from US West Coast engineers compared to other times of day or regions.**
**HA (Alternative Hypothesis, our claim): Posting at 2 AM specifically increases the interaction rates with users located in and representing U.S. Western states such as California more than posts made during peak hours for this region (i.e., daytime working hours).**

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- **Geolocation Data**: To confirm that interactions are coming from US West Coast engineers.
- **Time-stamped Engagement Metrics**:
    - Number of likes, comments, shares per post at different times throughout the day and specifically around midnight (i.e., postings made just before 2 AM).
    - Comparison with engagement metrics for posts targeting similar demographics but posted during peak working hours on US West Coast.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- **Sample Posts**: Create several high-quality, engaging content pieces identical in nature.
- **Posting Schedule (for one week)**:
    - Group A1 post at exactly 2 AM each day targeting interests relevant to California engineers for a period of seven days with similar engagement goals as other posts but posted around the peak time zone (9 PM PST) on alternate dates.

## 4. METRIC
- **Engagement Metric**: Compare average interaction rates, specifically focusing:
    - Average likes per post at midnight vs during working hours.
    - Geolocation-based user data for users engaging with these times compared to other posts targeted similarly but posted around peak time zones (9 PM PST).
- Aim for a significant difference in engagement metrics between the two groups.

## 5. DECISION RULE
**If A1 > X% more likes, comments/shares at midnight vs working hours AND geolocation data shows majority users are from US West Coast compared to non-midnight posts:**

Then we reject H0 and accept HA.
Else continue with additional experiments or reassess the hypothesis.

**Note:** An 80% confidence level is challenging for a single week's worth of experimentation given variability in human behavior. However, consistent results over multiple weeks would increase reliability toward establishing causation between posting at midnight targeting US West Coast engineers yielding significantly higher engagement metrics than those posted during working hours.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3 ("How-to" threads get more bookmarks than "Why-to")

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this hypothesis effectively, we need the following data points from a significant sample of both 'How-to' and 'Why-to' posts on Reddit or similar platforms where such content is shared.

- Number of times each thread (both How-to and Why-to) has been bookmarked.
- Total number of views for these threads to normalize bookmarking rates across different visibility levels. This helps us compare similarly visible how-tos with why-tos directly, without the confounding factor of one type naturally attracting more traffic than another due merely to popularity.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

We aim at gathering this data within a short span (e.g., 2 weeks) by scraping relevant threads from popular subreddits. This should be done for both How-to and Why-to categories across multiple timespans or days of the week, ensuring we capture any variations in bookmarking behavior.

## METRIC:
- **Bookmarking Rate**: Average number of bookmarks per thread.
  
We aim to establish a threshold where one type significantly outpaces another by 80% confidence. For instance:

- The average bookmark rate for How-to threads is at least X% higher than that of Why-to posts, with an 80% Confidence Interval (CI).

## DECISION RULE:
If the bookmarking rates can be statistically demonstrated to differ such that "How-tos" have a significantly lower mean compared to “Why-tos” and this difference meets our predetermined threshold for significance:

- **Y**: Conclude H3 is true. ("H3": How-to threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to')
  
If the data shows no significant differences or if Why-tos' bookmarking rates are equal/better under all conditions considered, we conclude that there isn't sufficient evidence to support H3.

This approach will help in understanding whether there's an inherent difference between how users bookmark "How-to" versus "Why-to", beyond mere chance. Adjustments may be necessary based on the collected data's specifics and any unforeseen limitations encountered during experiment execution.

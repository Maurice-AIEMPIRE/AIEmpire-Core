## Hypothesis
**H0:** Posting at 2 AM does not capture US West Coast engineers.

**H1:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers (alternative hypothesis).

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points:

- Number of posts made by an account.
- Time each post was published (specifically checking those posted around midnight).
- Location information related to where these users are located based on their IP addresses or any self-reported location in user profiles when available.

### Fastest Experiment:
A small-scale A/B test using a single, controlled social media channel accessible by US West Coast engineers can quickly provide preliminary insights. 

1. Create two different posts (identical content) scheduled to go live at 2 AM and one additional post of the same kind but posted around an average hour.
  
### Metric:
The exact metric we will monitor is **Engagement Rate** specifically looking for likes, comments or shares from US West Coast engineers identified through IP geolocation.

- Clicks/Interactions per Post = X
- Average interaction rate on posts at 2 AM (H1) > Engagement rate of average hour post (H0).
  
### Decision Rule:
If the engagement metrics significantly exceed those obtained during other times, we will reject H0 and accept that posting content around midnight captures US West Coast engineers. This means if X is consistently higher for time-stamped posts at 2 AM compared to similar quality but different timed postings.

Example decision rule: If **Engagement Rate (X) > Baseline Engagement rate by more than Y%** during the night, then H1 holds true; otherwise remain in testing or further experimentation with larger sample sizes.

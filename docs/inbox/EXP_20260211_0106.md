# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of posts made exactly at 2 AM on the Pacific Time Zone (PT) and Mountain Time Zone (MT).
2. Engagement metrics from these posts, including likes, comments, shares.
3. User demographics indicating whether they are located in Washington state or California within PT/Mountain time zone.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. **Preparation Phase**: 
   - Schedule a series of 10 social media post campaigns at exactly 2 AM PT (4 PM MT) targeting US West Coast engineers.
  
2. **Execution and Data Collection Phase:** Run the scheduled posts for one week, gathering engagement metrics daily.

3. **Measurement Criteria:** At the end of each day within this period:
   - Compare total interactions from these specific time-posted campaigns against a control group (posts made at 8 AM PT/12 PM MT) to check if there's statistically significant increased interaction and user demographics pointing towards US West Coast engineers engaging more during post-time.

### METRIC
- **Engagement Metric**: Increase in likes, comments, shares for posts scheduled specifically around 2 AM PT compared against a control group (posts at non-specified hours).
  
   Specifically:
     - Total engagements per hour across the campaign.
     - Demographic analysis focusing on Washington state or California users interacting with these time-posted campaigns.

### DECISION RULE
- **If** Average engagement rate and demographic percentage of US West Coast engineers is statistically significantly higher for posts made at 2 AM PT compared to control group (posts not timed specifically around this hour),
    - Then conclude that posting at 2 AM captures a significant portion of the targeted audience.
    
**Note:** Statistical significance can be tested using ANOVA or T-tests depending on data normality and sample size. For example, assuming we require an engagement rate increase to validate hypothesis:
- **Decision Metric (CTR):**
    - If CTR > X%, where 'X%' represents a pre-determined threshold for significant uplift above control group's average.

**Example Threshold:**

If the baseline interaction rates at 8 AM PT/12 PM MT is Y%,
   And if it’s determined through preliminary tests that an increase by Z% (e.g., from Y to X = Y + Z) can be statistically considered as capturing US West Coast engineers, we set this threshold for our experiments.

**Summary:**

- **Preparation Phase:** Schedule posts at 2 AM PT and control timing.
- **Execution & Measurement Phase:** Run experiment over one week; measure engagement metrics daily compared against non-specified hour (control group).
- Set a statistically significant CTR improvement as the decision rule to validate hypothesis.

## HYPOTHESIS
H3: "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of views for each post (to determine sample size)
- Total number of bookmark counts on both types ("how-to" and “why-to”) within a given timeframe.
  
  We need sufficient samples to test the hypothesis with statistical significance. For instance, we may aim at collecting data from thousands or even millions.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Smallest Test:
1. Identify 'How-to' posts that have received X views (e.g., >1000) on a given platform.
2. Record how many bookmarks these particular threads get in the next 24 hours period as an average for this sample size to represent "how-tos."
3. Do likewise with similar sized “Why-To” post samples.

We can use A/B Testing where we randomly select two equivalent groups of posts (both 'How-to' and ‘why-to’), one group serves as the control while another undergoes experimentation; in our case, this means adding a bookmark button to both "how-tos" & "why-to". Track how many bookmarks each post receives.
We must also ensure that these samples are collected from similar periods (e.g., weekday vs weekend) and platforms.

## METRIC
Exact number: Average bookmarking rate for 'How-To' posts compared against the average bookmark count of equivalent sized ‘Why-Two’ threads. We may want to aim at a minimum difference or increase in bookmarks (> 10%).

Alternatively, we could look into comparing CTRs (click-through rates) as well.

## DECISION RULE
If X: Average bookmarking rate for 'How-To' posts > Y + margin of error; then Y will be accepted that "how-to" threads get more bookmarks.
Conversely if the opposite is true or not statistically significant, it can reject H3. 

Note:

- Sample Size and Confidence Interval are important factors to decide on an experiment.

We could try this out with Reddit Threads (example) for a few weeks using their API as well.

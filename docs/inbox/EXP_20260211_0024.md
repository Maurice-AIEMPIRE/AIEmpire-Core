# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H0: Posting at 2 AM does not capture US West Coast engineers.

HA: Postings made specifically to engineering groups in the United States during peak working hours (9 am - 5 pm, Monday through Friday) are ignored by most of these users. Sub-hypotheses include:

- H1a: Engineering posts receive significantly fewer comments.
- H2b: Retweets and likes for relevant US West Coast engineers differ from other demographics.

## Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis we need the following data points:
- Timestamps on all post interactions (likes, retweets) by users located in California to accurately identify them as part of a professional engineering community.
- Number of posts made specifically targeting U.S. west coast communities versus those targeted globally or at other times/days.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
The smallest test would be:

1. Post an engaging content directed towards US West Coast engineers (such as the release date for new software tools relevant to their field) on platforms like LinkedIn.
2. Measure reactions and interaction within 72 hours, focusing solely on posts tagged with location/industry/city of San Francisco Bay Area.

## METRIC
An exact metric would be:
- Number of interactions received by post targeted at US West Coast engineers compared against other times/days or non-targeted content (e.g., CTR > X%).

## Decision Rule 
If the engagement rate on posts targeting U.S. west coast engineering groups is significantly lower than our baseline for similar, but untargeted and undated postings (>X% confidence), then we accept H0: Postings at 2 AM do not capture US West Coast engineers.

Note that this test would need to be repeated multiple times over a few weeks in order increase reliability of the results.

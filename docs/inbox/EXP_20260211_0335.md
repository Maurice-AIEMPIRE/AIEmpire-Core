# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Conversion rate (click-through rates) of aggressive vs polite copies.

  - Number of test impressions or views:
      * Total Views: X
  - Responses recorded per impression:

    | Copy Type       | Conversions |
    |-----------------|--------------|
    | Aggressive Copy | Y            |
    | Polite Copy     | Z            |

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT

Given that we want to test this hypothesis with the smallest possible sample size and still get an 80% confidence interval for a statistically significant result, we'll run A/B tests.

- Number of impressions per copy type = X / 2
- Minimum number of conversions required:

    - Aggressive Copy: Y > Z + (Z * ((1.96)²*0.25)/(X/4))
    - Polite Copy: Must not exceed the calculated threshold for aggressive copies above it.

Assuming a conservative estimate with an average conversion rate similar to standard benchmarks, we can calculate minimum impressions needed using these equations and aiming towards achieving this goal through iterative testing until reaching 80% confidence levels (which is approximately X = 5000).

## METRIC

Click-through rates:

- Aggressive Copy CTR: Y/X
- Polite Copy CTR: Z/(X/2)

Target for statistically significant difference can be set at a minimum of:
Aggressive Copy > 1.5 * polite copy's average conversion rate based on historical data.

**Threshold Example:** If past records show that aggressive copies typically convert around 4%, then we would aim to achieve an Aggressive CTR that's significantly higher (e.g., above the threshold), while Polite must not exceed this benchmark by much more than a margin of error acceptable for statistical significance.
 
## DECISION RULE

If our collected data shows:
Aggressive Copy's conversion rate is statistically significant (> 1.5 times polite copy) and meets or exceeds an established baseline from historical performance metrics, then we'll conclude the hypothesis as True (H0 rejected).

Conversely,
if Aggressive copies don't meet this threshold of significance compared to Polite ones within our calculated confidence interval based on minimal impressions required for a statistically significant result,

then we may have insufficient evidence either way.

**Threshold Example:**
- If Y/X > 1.5 * Z/(X/2) + margin_of_error, then H0 rejected (H1 is True)
- Else not enough data to conclude.

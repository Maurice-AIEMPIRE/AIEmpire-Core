## 1. Hypothesis
**H0:** Memes with code snippets do not go viral faster compared to memes without code snippets.

**H4 (Alternative):** Memes with code snippets go viral faster than those without them.


## 2. Evidence Required
- Number of views, shares, and likes for each meme.
- Time taken from posting until a certain threshold is reached that indicates virality (e.g., reaching one million views).
- The content type: memes containing only images vs memes with code snippets embedded in the image or video.

## 3. Fastest Experiment
Create two sets of identical memes, differing solely by whether they include brief and relevant programming language examples integrated into their imagery.
- Set A (Control): Standard meme format without any coding elements – e.g., GIFs/text/video/illustrations unrelated to code snippets but with humor or relatable content.

- Set B (Experimental): Meme variants that incorporate concise yet impactful pieces of actual working codes related directly within the image context—ensuring they are visually appealing and integrated well.


Both sets should be distributed through identical channels, ideally on platforms where tech communities congregate. The choice for these could include Twitter threads combined with Instagram posts or Reddit submissions targeted at programming-focused subreddits.

## 4. Metric
- Engagement Rate: Number of shares per total views.
- Virality Spike Duration (VSD): Time taken to hit a certain number of viral milestones like one million cumulative engagements.


To achieve an 80% confidence level for H0 vs H4, we would need:
- A sample size sufficient according to power analysis given the expected effect sizes. Suppose this requires at least X memes in each category.
- The experiment should run until either virality is confirmed or a predetermined time frame ends.

**METRIC:** Engagement Rate > 2% for Set B (Memes with code snippets) vs < 1% of any other engagement rate benchmarked against the control set.


## 5. Decision Rule
If Memes in **Set B**, containing coded elements, exhibit an Engagment Spike Duration (VSD) significantly shorter than that observed and above a predetermined threshold for Set A within our sample size range X—then we reject H0.

This simplified structure outlines how to test the hypothesis with minimum complexity while still providing statistically significant results. Note: Actual required number of memes would depend on expected variation in engagement, which is typically determined through prior experimentation or pilot studies and involves a power analysis for accurate estimation.

# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy."

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- Conversion rate of aggressive copies versus polite copies.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT (80% Confidence Level):
- Randomly select two sample groups from the target audience.
  - Group A will receive messages with an "aggressive" tone/copy.
  - Group B will get a version translated to have similar wordings but in a less aggressive, more polite manner.

### METRIC:
1. Conversion Rate (CR) = Number of Conversions / Total Contacts
2. Determine the minimum sample size needed using power analysis tools considering desired confidence level and effect size for achieving 80% confidence.
3. The experiment should run until at least one conversion rate from either group exceeds or falls behind by a statistically significant margin that can be attributed to copy tone (aggressive vs polite).

### DECISION RULE:
- If the absolute difference between Group A's CR and Group B’s CR is greater than X, then aggressive copies are conclusively better.
  - Where X would need to satisfy statistical tests like ANOVA or Chi-Square for a significant result at an alpha level of typically set as <0.05.

*Note: This experiment assumes the audience segment exposed similarly in terms of demographics and interests across groups A & B.*

### Notes:
- "Aggressive" vs "Polite" tones should be predefined based on linguistic analysis to ensure consistent interpretation.
- The conversion rate (CR) metric is chosen as it directly relates to business goals, typically revenue generation or user sign-ups.

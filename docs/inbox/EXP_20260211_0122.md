# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis on Posting Timing

## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** "Posting at midnight captures US West Coast engineers."

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- **Number of posts made exactly at 12 AM Pacific Time (PT).**
- **Engagement metrics per post such as likes, comments and shares.**
- **Time zone distribution data for commenters to confirm they are on the US West Coast.
- Demographic information like location details if available.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
**Week-long Test:**

1. Post 10 times at exactly midnight PT over a week (Sunday through Saturday).
2. Ensure each post is identical in content and presentation style for consistency across all posts to avoid variation due to other factors.
3. Record engagement metrics per post.

---

### METRIC:

- **Click-through rate (CTR):** Aim for CTR > 1%. 
- A significantly higher than normal baseline will be considered successful, but at least a doubling of the average daily interactions on similar content posted during business hours would serve as an initial benchmark.
  
---

### DECISION RULE:
If we observe that engagement metrics such as likes, comments and shares are **more significant** (e.g., 50% higher than our baseline) for posts made exactly at midnight PT compared to other times of the day over a week with consistent results across multiple days.

Then conclude:

- The time slot around noon on Tuesday Eastern Time captures US West Coast engineers.

Note: Always respect user consent and privacy, as well as platform guidelines. For an ethical experiment design that respects participants' data protection rights (such posts are not typically targeted to specific individuals but rather a larger audience), it would be advisable instead of targeting personal demographic information directly.

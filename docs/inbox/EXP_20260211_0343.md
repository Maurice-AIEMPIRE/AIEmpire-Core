## Hypothesis
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis effectively and gather sufficient data points for a statistically significant result at an 80% confidence level (equivalent to achieving power of the experiment as close to or equal to 0.8), we would need:

1. Conversion rates from both aggressive copies (`AGC`) vs polite copy (`PC`).
2. The number needed per conversion, which tells us how many clicks it takes for a user exposed to an `AGC` versus someone who sees the `PC`.
3. Baseline data showing current average conversions before implementing either type of copy.

---

### Fastest Experiment:
A small-scale A/B test should be conducted where 10% (in other words, one-tenth) sample size is allocated equally between both conditions (`AGC` and `PC`). This would still provide a robust statistical analysis for comparison. Ideally with an even distribution across different demographics to ensure diversity.

---

### Metric:
The exact metric we will focus on monitoring closely during this experiment:

- Conversion rate improvement (CRI): A 20% increase in conversion rates from the polite copy (`PC`) is our benchmark.
    - For example, if `CRP` = PC's current average CTR,
        CRI would mean that AGC must yield a conversion rate of at least **1.2 * CRP**.

---

### Decision Rule:
We will apply this simple decision rule:

- If the observed increase in conversions from aggressive copy (`AGC`) exceeds 20% compared to polite copy (PC), then we accept H1 as true.
    - In other words, if `CRG` = Aggressive Copy's conversion rate > **1.2 * CRP** for PC
        We conclude that the hypothesis is supported.

- If AGC does not exceed this threshold of improvement over PC by 20%, or there isn't a significant difference in conversions between aggressive copy (`AGC`) and polite copy (PC), then H1 will be rejected.
    - In other words, if `CRG` <= **1.2 * CRP**
        We reject the hypothesis that AGC converts better than PC.

This structured approach provides clarity on what we aim to test with this experiment while keeping it focused enough for timely results but robust in terms of statistical analysis and decision-making based on observed outcomes.

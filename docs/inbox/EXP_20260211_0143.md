# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** Direct Messages containing the phrase "Value First" receive three times more replies compared to messages without this phrasing.

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED

To test hypothesis **H1**, we need:

- A dataset of direct message (DM) interactions.
  - Number of DMs sent with and without 'Value First' content in each group.
  - Total number of responses received for the same set of messages within a specified timeframe.

---

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT

**Objective:** Achieve at least an **80% confidence level** to validate hypothesis H1 using minimal data points while maintaining statistical significance. This involves:

- Sending out DMs with "Value First" in 100 randomly chosen instances.
- Simultaneously, send another set of DM without the phrase for a comparable number (around 32) as per power analysis requirements.

*Note: The exact numbers may vary slightly based on initial variance observed.*

---

## METRIC

Monitor and compare:

**Response Rate Ratio:** `Number_of_Responses_with_Value_First / Number_of_DMs_sent_with_Value_First` against `Number_of_Responses_without_Value_First / Number_of_DMs_sent_without_Value_First`

A **Positive Result (Support for H1)** would be indicated by a ratio of at least 3:1.

---

## DECISION RULE

- If the calculated response rate ratios meet or exceed our defined threshold (>2.5 considering potential rounding), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that DMs with 'Value First' get approximately three times more replies.
  
*Note:* An adjustment for multiple testing may be required based on further analysis.

**Rationale:** This decision rule is set to ensure a robust test of H1 while taking into account variability in responses due solely or partly related factors (e.g., time sent, recipient engagement level). Further refinement might consider adjusting the threshold after examining initial data trends and variances.

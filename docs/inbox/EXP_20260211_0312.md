# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis H3

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
"H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'."

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of clicks on "bookmark" button in both categories (How-to and Why-to)
- Total number of posts for each category to normalize results

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A simple A/B testing experiment can be conducted where an equal amount of new 'How-to' threads are posted alongside the same quantity of existing or newly created 'Why-to' threads.

## 4. METRIC
- The average number of bookmarks per post for each category.
  
E.g., Average Bookmarks/Thread (How-to) vs. Average Bookmarks/Thread (Why-to).

Target Metric: To achieve a statistically significant result at an alpha level of less than 0.05, with power close to or above 80%.

## 5. DECISION RULE
- If the average bookmarks per post for "How-to" threads are significantly higher by X% compared to those in 'Why-to' category (e.g., a difference >15%), conclude that H3 is true.
  
Example Decision Rule: *If Average Bookmarks/Thread (How-to) > 1.5*Average Bookmarks/Thread (Why-to), then accept the hypothesis.*

### Additional Notes:
- Randomly assign an equal number of threads to each category for unbiased results
- Ensure sufficient sample size based on expected variance and desired power level.
- Collect data over a fixed period or until statistical significance is achieved.

End your experiment once you reach 80% confidence in supporting H3. Use the collected average bookmarks per post metric as evidence, applying appropriate t-tests to validate significant differences between categories if necessary.

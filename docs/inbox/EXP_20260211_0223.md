# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H5"

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies."

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of DMs sent containing the phrase 'Value First'.
- Total number of responses received from these DMs.
- Control group DM (without "Value First") for comparison, including:
  - Number of control-group DMs sent not using the term.
  - Total number of replies to those control-group DMs.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
Conduct a small-scale experiment with an equal split between 'Value First' and non-'Value First' messages (e.g., 50 each). Ensure that both groups are similar in terms of audience demographics, time sent/received, etc.

- Run this test for one week to gather enough data points.
  
## 4. METRIC
Number of replies received per DM should be the primary metric:
\[ \text{Replies per 'Value First' DM} > X = CTR_{V_FDM}\]
Where \(X\) is calculated as follows (assuming a baseline conversion rate for comparison):
1. Baseline Conversion Rate from control group.
2. Targeted 80% confidence level requires at least an increase in replies by \(\frac{3}{4}\).

## 5. DECISION RULE
If Replies per 'Value First' DM > X, then "H5" is accepted as true.

Example Calculation:
- Baseline Conversion Rate (CTR) from control group = Y%.
- Target Metric: CTR_{V_FDM} should be greater than \(1.75 \times Y\).

In summary:

| Category                  | Value First DMs  | Control Group DM |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Number Sent               | X                | X                 |
| Total Responses Received  | A + B            | C + D             |

If (A+B) / X > \(1.75 \times\frac{(C+D)}{X}\), then "H5" is accepted as true.

By monitoring the responses to 'Value First' messages versus non-'Value First', we can statistically determine if they indeed receive three times more replies, thereby validating or invalidating H5 with high confidence.

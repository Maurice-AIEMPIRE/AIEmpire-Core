## Experiment Design

### Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

### Evidence Required
- Number of posts in both "How-to" and "Why-to" categories over a specified period (e.g., last 6 months).
- The number of times each post was bookmarked.
  
Data Points Needed:
1. Total count of how-many to-do threads for the time frame selected (`H3_count_How_to`).
2. Total count of why-make-thread posts in those categories during that same period (`Why_to_count_Why_to`).

### Fastest Experiment
To get 80% confidence, we can observe a single week (7 days), given our aim is to see if there’s an observable trend rather than confirming statistically significant results. 

Fast Test: 
- Count the total number of how-to and why-do threads in each category for seven consecutive weekdays.
- Record the bookmarks received by both types on these posts.

### Metric
Exact Number:
1. Click-through Rate (CTR) Comparison between 'How-to' vs 'Why-to'.
2. Average Bookmark Per Post ratio (`Average_Bookmarks_How_to` and `Average_Booksmark_WhoTo`) for each category.
   
Comparison Target: 
- CTR of How-to Threads > 5%
- Bookmarks on average per post in the Why-to threads should be less than that observed with how-many to-do's.

### Decision Rule
If both:
1. The number of bookmarks received by posts tagged as "How-to" significantly exceed those posted under tags like 'Why-to'.
2. Average bookmarks for a single How-to thread exceeds 5% CTR while being lower in Why-to threads, then H3 is confirmed.
    
Otherwise: If neither condition holds true with sufficient confidence levels (like observing these results over the fast experiment), we cannot confirm this hypothesis.

The described test structure enables testing of an initial trend by examining a smaller sample set. Further examination can be conducted once more significant data points are collected, and statistical analysis performed to ensure 80% confidence level in observed trends.

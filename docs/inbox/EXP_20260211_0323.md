# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
"How-to" threads receive more bookmarks than "Why-to" threads.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of 'How-to' and 'Why-to' posts per time period (e.g., daily, weekly).
2. Total number of bookmarks received by each type ("How-to" vs. "Why-to").
3. User engagement metrics for both types: comments count.
4. Time spent on pages with these threads.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. **Initial Data Collection Period**:
   - Collect data from the first 7 days to establish a baseline of bookmarks and user interactions (comments, time spent) across 'How-to' vs. 'Why-to'.

2. **Post Baseline Results for Confirmation Phase:**
   - Continue collecting daily bookmark counts over an additional week.
  
3. **Sample Size Calculation**:
    To achieve 80% confidence with a power of at least 0.8, calculate the required sample size using standard statistical formulas.

## METRIC:

- Difference in average number of bookmarks between 'How-to' and 'Why-to'.
- Statistical significance level (p-value): < 0.05 to reject null hypothesis.
  
For example:
   - Target Metric: Average Bookmarks for "How-to" > Average Bookmarks for "Why-to"

## DECISION RULE:

1. If the difference in average bookmarks between ‘How-to’ and 'Why-to' is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), conclude that “How-to” threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.
2. Additionally, check if user engagement metrics such as comments count or time spent significantly differ.

Using this structure ensures a rigorous approach to testing the hypothesis about bookmark behavior between different types of posts on websites like Stack Overflow or GitHub Discussions.

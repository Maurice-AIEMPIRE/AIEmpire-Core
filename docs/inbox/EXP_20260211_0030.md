# Hypothesis Testing Experiment

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this hypothesis scientifically and statistically robustly, we need the following data points collected over a significant period of time to ensure sufficient sample size for reliable results.

1. Number of posts labeled as "How-to" in specific forums or blogs.
2. Total number of bookmarks on each post marked with “How-to”.
3. Number of posts labeled as "Why-to" (control category) within the same platforms/browsers over a comparable timeframe to those 'How-to' threads, but without any modifications such as tags other than their intrinsic label ("Why-to").
4. Total number of bookmarks on each post marked with “Why-to”.
5. The time taken for posts labeled "How-to" and "Why-to" respectively from the moment they are posted until bookmarked.
6. Demographic information about users who bookmark, including age range (if appropriate), gender, geographic location etc., to control or adjust variables related to user behavior patterns.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

The smallest experiment would involve choosing a set of recently created "How-to" and corresponding matched pairs ("Why-to") posts that have been live for less than 24 hours. The sample size should ideally contain at least dozens, if not hundreds or thousands (as per the forum/blog's traffic), to provide an adequate dataset representing user interaction patterns.

---

### METRIC:

We will focus on two key metrics: bookmark ratio and time-to-bookmark.
1. Bookmark Ratio = Total Bookmarks for "How-to" Posts / Number of “How-to” posts
2. Time-to-Bookmark (average) = Sum(Individual Times to be bookmarked) /  Count(Numbers of bookmarks)

---

### DECISION RULE:

If the bookmark ratio of a sample set exceeds twice that expected under random chance, and if time taken for "Why-to" threads is significantly higher than average times observed across different posts or user groups. Then: Y= 'How-to' Posts get more Bookmarks (H3) 

An independent t-test could be performed on the bookmark ratio of both categories ("How-to", "Why-to") to determine if there are statistically significant differences between them.

Alternatively, a chi-squared test can compare observed frequencies against expected ones based upon random chance. A confidence interval or p-value less than 0.05 would indicate that H3 is true (with at least an 80% level of statistical significance).

## NOTES: 

The experiment should account for potential confounders such as content quality, subject matter relevance to the target demographic etc., which can affect user interaction patterns.

Additionally, this hypothesis testing could be extended beyond bookmarks alone. Other metrics like shares (for social media sharing), replies/comments received by each type of post or time spent viewing/read posts after being bookmarked should also considered for a more comprehensive understanding and insight into what makes users bookmark certain types of content on any given platform/blog/forum.

Lastly, it is crucial to note that the experiment above assumes there are no other factors at play (e.g. SEO tactics like tags/SEO keywords etc.) which could affect user interaction patterns such as bookmarking behavior; these should also be accounted for in order not to skew results or lead into incorrect conclusions regarding H3’s validity.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts.

- **Hypothesis:** How-to content receives significantly higher bookmark rates compared to Why-to content on the same platform, after controlling for confounding variables such as time of day and thread length.
  
  Alternative Hypothesis (HA): There is no significant difference in bookmarking behavior between how-to threads versus why-to threads when considering other factors like timing or post length.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of bookmarks per "How-to" thread over a specified period, compared to the corresponding number for each 'Why-to' thread.
- Control variables: Time since posting (to control freshness), total word count in posts and replies under them which can impact engagement levels significantly.


## FASTEST EXPERIMENT

To achieve 80% confidence as quickly as possible:

1. Select a diverse sample of "How-to" threads alongside 'Why-to' counterparts that have been active for at least one week to ensure freshness.
2. Randomly select posts across different times (morning, afternoon) from each thread category and record the number of bookmarks received in 24 hours.

   **Sample Size:** At minimum, five matched pairs per hour/day combination must be observed until we accumulate enough data points that statistically show a significant difference with an 80% confidence level.


## METRIC

- The primary metric to monitor will be Bookmark Count Per Hour/Post (BCPH) for each category of threads.

**Target Metric Threshold:** A BCPH average increase by at least X percent in "How-to" posts compared to 'Why-to' without any confounding variables influencing the results excessively.


## DECISION RULE

- If after sampling and analysis, the observed mean difference between bookmark counts per hour/post for how-tos versus why-tos exceeds a predefined significance threshold (e.g., p-value < 0.05), then we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to state H1 over HA.

**Threshold Definition:** A statistically significant increase in bookmarking rates by "How-to" threads compared with 'Why-to' posts, after adjusting for confounders and reaching an 80% confidence level based on the collected data points (sample size calculated above).

Note: The details about sample sizes or specific metrics like X percent would depend heavily upon preliminary analysis to determine what constitutes a significant difference in bookmarking rates. Further research might also be necessary if additional variables are discovered that significantly impact bookmark counts, requiring adjustments before reaching any conclusion.

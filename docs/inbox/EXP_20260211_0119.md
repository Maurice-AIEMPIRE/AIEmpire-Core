# Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS:
- **H3** ("How-to" threads get more bookmarks than "Why-to".)

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this hypothesis effectively with rigorous experimental design and statistical significance (80% confidence), we need the following data points for both types of posts within a specified time frame on Reddit or any other platform that supports such thread categorization.

- Total number of 'How-to' threads created.
- Number of bookmarks collected by all these 'How-to' threads combined over this period. This includes initial and subsequent bookmark counts, as well users may come back to add more bookmarks after the original posting time frame has passed (to test long-term bookmarking behavior).
  
  For comparison:
 
- Total number of "Why-to" posts created.
- Number of bookmarks collected by all these 'Why-to' threads combined over this period.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

Given that we're interested in achieving approximately an 80% confidence level, which typically requires a large sample size depending on the variance within our data points (bookmark counts), we propose conducting preliminary tests across different subreddits to determine variability and then scaling up accordingly. As fast as possible is constrained by Reddit's API rate limits or other platform limitations; however, we'll start with smaller samples.

- Select 3 diverse Subreddits.
  
  For each subreddit:

    - Randomly select one 'How-to' post that received at least X initial bookmarks within Y time frame (to be determined through preliminary testing for variance).
    
      Repeat this process to gather a sample of N = ~20 such posts per subreddit. This is our total dataset.

- Do the same with "Why-to" threads under identical conditions.
  
  Note: To maintain experimental integrity, we must avoid cross-posting or altering thread content which might affect their initial bookmark count naturally over time due to organic growth in interest (e.g., new users discovering them).

## METRIC:

The primary metric will be the total number of bookmarks collected by 'How-to' threads versus "Why-to" threads. Given our dataset, we can calculate an average bookmarking rate per thread for each category and compare these rates directly.

- Average bookmark count / Total posts (in both categories) = Bookmarking Rate Per Post

## DECISION RULE:

If the *bookmarking rate of 'How-to'* > 1.5 times that **of "Why-to"** threads with statistical significance, then we conclude H3 is true within our confidence level.

Statistical analysis methods like t-tests or Chi-square tests (depending on data distribution) will be used to confirm if differences observed are statistically significant and not due by chance alone at 80% CI. The exact calculation for N depends upon preliminary variance testing as mentioned above, but a rough starting point based off standard statistical power calculations can guide initial sample size determination.

This structure provides an outline of how we might go about designing such experiment with necessary modifications depending on the specific platform being tested and any unique characteristics it may have that could affect bookmarking behavior.

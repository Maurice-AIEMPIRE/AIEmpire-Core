## Experiment Design

### Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### Evidence Required
- Number of "How-to" and "Why-to" thread posts in a specific period (e.g., one month).
- Total number of backlinks each post receives from users during this time frame.
- Separate bookmark counts for both categories.

**Data Points Needed:**
1. Category classification ("How-to" or "Why-to").
2. Post ID corresponding to the category and its backlink count over a specified period (e.g., one month).
3. Number of bookmarks each post receives from users during this time frame.
4. Total number of posts classified as 'How-to' vs. total numbers for ‘Why-to’ threads.

---

### Fastest Experiment
1. Select two active forums with similar user engagement levels and categories containing "How-to" and "Why-to".
2. Track all new thread submissions in both formats over a one-month period.
3. Use automated tools or scripts to track backlinks (i.e., references/browsing links) for each post during this time frame.

---

### Metric
- **Bookmark Count:** The number of bookmarks received by posts tagged as 'How-to' compared with those labeled "Why-to".

**Exact Number:**
The bookmark count per thread should have at least an 80% confidence interval that shows a significant difference between the two categories. 

For instance:
- If we collect data from both types over one month, and analyze if there's more than twice as many bookmarks in 'How-to' threads compared to "Why-to" ones.

---

### Decision Rule
**If:** The bookmark count per post for “How-to” is statistically significantly higher (e.g., with a difference greater by 20% or more) **Then:**

- Conclude that H3 ("How-to" posts get more bookmarks than 'Why-to') holds true, as the observed mean differences are significant at an alpha level of less than .05.

### Notes:
1. Random sampling may be used to avoid bias.
2. Ensure a consistent measurement period across both categories for fair comparison (e.g., one month).
3. Consider confounding factors like post quality and user engagement in your analysis, adjusting if necessary.

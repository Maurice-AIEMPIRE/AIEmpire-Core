# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy."

## HYPOTHESIS
Aggressive copy conversions are on average **20% higher** compared to politeness in terms of conversion rate.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED

### Data Points Needed:
- Conversion rates (percentage) for both aggressive and polite copies.
- Sample size sufficient enough to achieve statistical significance at 80% confidence level, typically around a large sample given the expected difference is only marginally above baseline performance metrics like CTR (>2%).

Specifically: 
1. Number of clicks on each type of copy text per set amount (e.g., number of emails sent).
2. Baseline conversion rate without aggressive/polite copies for comparison.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT

### Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence:
- Use a quick A/B test with two small groups: one seeing the polite version and another seeing an aggressively phrased copy.
  
   **Sample Size Calculation** (using Cohen’s table):
   
   - Desired Power = 0.8
   - Alpha level (p-value) for significance testing ≈ 5% to 10%
   - Expected effect size difference in conversion rates.

Assume baseline CTR is around 1%, with an expected increase of roughly up to another percentage point from aggressive copy due to the marginal increment hypothesis:

- Baseline Conversion Rate = ~2%

Given this, we can run a quick experiment. To achieve statistically significant results at approximately 80% confidence level for such minimal effects (20%), even though it’s usually larger samples are preferred.

### Experiment Execution:
1. Randomly divide visitors into two equally large groups.
2. Display aggressive copy to Group A and polite copies to Group B over an equal time frame with equivalent conditions other than the text variant used in conversion prompts or CTA buttons ("Click Here", "Buy Now").

## METRIC
**Exact Number:**
- Average Conversion Rate (Aggressive vs Polite) increase by at least **20%**

### Specific Metric:
If aggressive copy achieves a CTR ≥ 2.4%, it can be considered significantly better than polite versions achieving <1%.

## DECISION RULE

**Decision Thresholds and Rule:** 

| Decision   | Condition                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Accept Hypothesis (H0 rejected) | Aggressive Copy Conversion Rate Increase > 20% compared to Polite Copy |

If the observed increase in conversion rate for aggressive copy meets or exceeds this threshold, we reject H0. Otherwise, if results do not meet expectations set by confidence interval and margin of error assumptions underlined earlier based on baseline performance metrics:

- If difference ≤ insignificant margins (e.g., < 2%), then fail to accept hypothesis at desired significance levels.

**Note:** Given expected effect sizes for marginal improvements in conversion rates typically seen across online marketing, achieving significant results requires larger sample size. Therefore actual samples need careful calculation through statistical power analysis tools prior running such experiment.

# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of posts in both "How-to" and "Why-to" categories over a fixed period (e.g., one month).
2. Total number of views for each post within these two categories.
3. The total number of times bookmarked by users per category.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- Select 10 popular threads from the 'How-to' posts with at least X visitors and Y average upvotes over a week to track their bookmarking behavior compared against similar metrics (X, Y) for "Why-to" posts.
  
## METRIC:
1. Bookmarks per post: Averages bookmarks received by each thread divided into 10 samples from both categories.

## DECISION RULE
- If the mean number of bookmarks on 'How-to' threads is greater than that in 'Why-to', then H3 holds true (i.e., bookmark rate > X% for 'How-to'). Otherwise, we cannot conclude a statistically significant difference. This would require statistical analysis to confirm significance at an 80% confidence level.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure both categories have similar characteristics such as popularity.
- Posts should be matched based on views and average upvotes (e.g., posts with X visitors AND Y average upvotes).
- Statistical Significance must consider the sample size, variance within each category's bookmarks per post.

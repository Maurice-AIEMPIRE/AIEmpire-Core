# Rigorous Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## Evidence Required
1. Number of views (pageviews) for both "How-to" and "Why-to" threads over a specified period.

2. The number of unique users who bookmark each type ("How-to" vs. "Why-to").

3. Total time spent on the pages by visitors to compare engagement levels between types.


## Fastest Experiment
1. Identify 10 active websites where both 'How-to' and 'Why-to' threads are prevalent.
2. Record data for a one-month period.

3. Analyze bookmark frequency relative to views within this timeframe, aiming at an average sample size that is statistically significant (e.g., per day).


## Metric

The primary metric will be the percentage of viewed pages bookmarked by users:

- 'How-to' Bookmark Percentage: Average percent increase in bookmarking activity.
  
- Compare against a control rate for general webpage bookmark rates.


Target confidence level must reach 80%, which might require several iterations or extended periods to obtain accurate enough data. A margin of error under this threshold would be ideal (e.g., +/- 3% from the average).


## Decision Rule

If 'How-to' threads have an increased bookmarking percentage by a statistically significant amount (> X%) compared with general bookmark rates and significantly above "Why-to" rate, then Y: The hypothesis that 'How-to' pages receive more bookmarks is supported.


Note: A statistical significance threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) should be applied to validate the experiment's results beyond a reasonable doubt.

# Experiment Design for Testing Viral Potential of Memes with Code Snippets

## Hypothesis
**H1:** "Memes containing code snippets go viral faster compared to memes without any coding content."

This hypothesis specifically states that the inclusion of a code snippet within meme formats contributes positively towards virality.

### 1. Evidence Required:
- **Creation & Distribution Data:**
  - Number and type (with/without code) of created memes.
  - Platforms used for distribution, timestamped records on when each was posted/reposted/refreshed by users.
  
- **Engagement Metrics:** 
  - Likes
  - Shares/Reposts Count
  - Comments count

- **Time-Series Data:**
  - Growth rate (daily increase in shares/likes/comments) over time.

---

### 2. Fastest Experiment:
To achieve an initial understanding with high confidence, use a controlled sample size across social media platforms for short-term viral activity:

1. Create two sets of memes equally appealing to target audiences without prior knowledge about meme content.
   - Set A: Standard Meme Formats (without code snippets)
   - Set B: Memes containing brief and simple "code-like" text patterns or ASCII art representing codes

2. Post these on social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit’s r/MemeMagic subreddit, Instagram Story.

3. Track engagement metrics within 24 hours to capture initial virality factors for comparison:

### 3. Metric:
The primary metric will be the **Engagement Growth Rate (EGR)** defined as follows: 

**Formula:** `(New Total Engagement - Initial Total Engagement) / Time Spent in Hours`

- We aim at an engagement increase rate exceeding a threshold indicative of virality.
  
Example Thresholds for Metrics to Compare:

1. Memes with code snippets must show more than 50% higher EGR compared to standard memes within the first hour.

2. The cumulative total number and growth metrics tracked across posts after initial hours should statistically validate viral propagation faster by at least a factor of two (e.g., shares/reposts count).

---

### 4. Decision Rule:
Based on collected data, you will determine if H1 holds true:

- If Memes with code snippets show significantly higher engagement rates compared to standard memes within the set observation period.
  
  **Decision:**
   - Accept Hypothesis \(H1\) (Memes go viral faster): Move forward for extended testing or further refinement of meme design strategies incorporating coding elements.

---

### Summary:

This structured, controlled experiment allows us an initial quick validation step towards confirming if memes with coded content indeed have a higher virality potential. The fast feedback loop and clear metrics set up will provide actionable insights efficiently within short time frames across different social media platforms.

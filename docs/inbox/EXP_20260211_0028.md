# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis on Posting Time

## HYPOTHESIS
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of posts made during different times (e.g., hourly intervals) over a specified period, specifically focusing on the time around midnight.
2. The geographical location data indicating if those who interacted with or viewed these postings are located in the US and within the Western Time Zone for West Coast engineers.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Run an A/B test where half of your posts (Group A) is scheduled at 2 AM, while another set (Group B) uses a control time slot that typically attracts less traffic.
2. Collect engagement data such as likes, shares, comments from both groups over one week.

## METRIC: Exact number to watch
1. Engagement Rate for Group A vs. Control Group B:
   - Calculate the total engagements per post and average them out by hour if needed (e.g., CTR > 0.5% or higher).

## DECISION RULE: If X, then Y.
- IF engagement rate of posts scheduled at 2 AM is statistically significantly greater than control group postings AND majority interactions are from West Coast engineers compared to other regions THEN we can conclude that posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast Engineers.

### Summary

1. **HYPOTHESIS**: Posting at 2 AM (midnight) will result in higher engagement specifically among US West Coast engineering professionals.
   
2. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:
   - Post counts and engagements across different times of the day, focusing on midnight for Group A vs Control time slot B.

3. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT**: 
    - Run an hour-based split test (e.g., every 4 hours) to quickly gather preliminary engagement data over a week.
   
4. **METRIC TO WATCH**:
   - Compare average post engagements between Group A and the control group with at least 80% confidence interval.

5. **DECISION RULE**: 
    - Determine if there is significant higher interaction (e.g., CTR or total interactions) from US West Coast engineers in posts scheduled for midnight compared to other times, confirming your hypothesis.

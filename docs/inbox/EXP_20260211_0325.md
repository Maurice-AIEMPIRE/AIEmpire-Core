# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies compared to DMs without the phrase."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of responses received by a sample set (Group A) where messages include "Value First."
2. Number of responses from another comparable group (Group B) that do not contain this message.
3. Total number of participants in both groups and their engagement levels to ensure comparability.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Select two equal-sized, random samples:
   - Group A: 200 messages containing "Value First."
   - Group B: 66 responses without the phrase (since we expect a threefold increase).
2. Conduct this experiment over one week for consistency and to avoid temporal biases.

## METRIC
- Number of replies received from each message in both groups.
  
If:
1. Average number of replies per 'Value First' DM = X,
   Then Group A's average should be 3X times that seen on average by messages without the phrase (Group B).

**Target Metric for Decision Rule:**
> If Mean Replies per Message containing "Value First" > x * [Mean Replies per message not using “Value First”] where x ≈ 3, then H5 is supported.

## DECISION RULE
- **If:** The average number of replies (X) received from DMs with 'Value First' phrases are at least three times the baseline reply rate obtained without it.
  
**Conclusion:**
Based on this metric and comparison:
> If X >= 3 * Baseline Reply Rate, then H5 is supported.

The above experiment plan ensures a robust statistical analysis of whether incorporating "Value First" in DMs significantly increases replies by at least three times. The data points collected will enable us to apply appropriate inferential statistics (such as t-tests or chi-square tests) for confirming the hypothesis with an 80% confidence level, assuming normality and equal variance between groups.

# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H0: DMs with 'Value First' do not get three times more replies compared to others.

Ha1: H5: DMs with 'Value First' receive 3x the number of replies (positive response rate) as those without it, assuming other conditions are equal.
    
    H2: Dm with no specific prompt gets significantly fewer responses than a DM that uses any variation on "Value First".

## Evidence Required
- Total Responses Counted per day/week/month for each type:
  - 'Value First' prompts (VFP)
  - Other variations of the same theme as VFP 
  - No significant value-related keyword in DMs

- Additional data points include time spent replying to these messages, engagement rate with replies if applicable.

## Fastest Experiment
A split test using a random sample. Send out an equal number of 'Value First' prompts (VFP) and control message variants that do not contain this phrase over the same timeframe in both conditions.
- Randomly select DM users for VFPs across different times to avoid temporal bias related to weekday/weekend/festival periods.

## Metric
Positive response rate per day/month:  Total positive responses/Total messages sent with 'Value First' prompt compared to control groups (non-VFP).

Decide on a time frame based upon the expected speed of replies. A smaller sample could be used but might require longer observation for meaningful results, e.g., one week.
- The ideal metric is an increase in response rate by 3x from VFPs vs controls.

## Decision Rule
If positive responses per day/month to 'Value First' prompts (VFP) are at least three times the average of control groups and statistically significant using a chosen statistical test, then H5 can be accepted. Otherwise reject Ha1.
- An increased response rate by 3x compared with non-VFP messages is considered sufficient evidence for acceptance/rejection under this experiment.

# Additional Considerations
* Randomization ensures comparability between VFP vs control groups (matching time-of-day and message context).
* Control Groups: Should vary in theme to test if the increase stems from 'Value First' specifically or other factors.
* Test period long enough that at least 80% confidence level can be reached, with a total sample size of N = min(5000/VFP, 5000/Control) for each category. If not sufficient after initial experiment runs (N < 50), extend duration by doubling the test time up to three times maximum.

# Conclusion
A rigorous split-test design using randomization and control groups allows a fair assessment if 'Value First' prompts get significantly more replies than others, assuming no other major changes in messaging trends or external factors. A successful positive response rate increase of 3x would strongly indicate that including the phrase "Value first" makes messages stand out enough to prompt significant engagement from recipients compared with control groups.

## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts **20% better than polite copy**.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- Number of clicks (conversions) from aggressive vs. polite copies for a comparable audience segment and similar context/environment conditions over the same time period.
  
  | Metric            | Group A: Polite Copy | Group B: Aggressive Copy |
  |-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
  | Clicks / Impressions     | x1                    | y1                        |

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To get **80% confidence**, we need to collect a sufficient amount of data points. According to power analysis for A/B testing, typically around `n = 300` observations per group should be adequate given the hypothesis suggests looking at small incremental differences (e.g., ~20%).

- Run both copy variations in parallel.
  
### Experiment Duration:
**1 week**

## METRIC
We will measure **click-through rate (CTR)** for each version.

The precise number to watch is:

```
Difference between Group B's CTR and Polite Copy’s CTR ≥ 0.2 or Y/B - X/A > 20%
```

- We set the metric as a difference in clicks per impression, aiming at achieving **≥ 20%** improvement for aggressive copy over polite.

## DECISION RULE
If `Y / y1 = x + 20%` then we accept H0 (null hypothesis), implying that there is no significant conversion rate advantage to using an aggressive copy. Otherwise reject the null and conclude with confidence in our alternate hypotheses: **H2** - Polite Copy performs better or equally compared to Aggressive Copy.
 
## Notes:
- Ensure random assignment of visitors/target audience for both versions during experiment duration.
- Control variables such as time, geographical region/age group/city/popularity among other characteristics (e.g., device type) across the test groups. 

**Time Limit: 1 week**

# Conclusion
A well-designed A/B testing with careful control over external factors and a significant amount of data can yield conclusive evidence for or against H0, giving us confidence in our results.

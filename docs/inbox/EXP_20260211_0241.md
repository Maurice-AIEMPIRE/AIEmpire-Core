# Experiment Design for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than DMs without it.

---

### 1. EVIDENCE REQUIRED
- Number of responses received from each DM (with and without the "Value First" label).
  
### 2. FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest test to achieve 80% confidence level.
To quickly gather data, we need at least two groups for comparison:
- Group A: DMs with 'Value First' included in their message body or signature (at least N=100 messages sent randomly within a given time period).
- Group B: Standard DM without the "Value First" label.

### 3. METRIC
The key metric to monitor is **Response Rate** for each group, which can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Response Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Responses}}{\text{Total Number of Messages Sent}} \]

We aim that the response rate in Group A (with "Value First") exceeds three times more replies than Group B's by at least 80% confidence level.

### 4. DECISION RULE
If **Response Rate_A > Response Rate_B * 3**, then we accept our hypothesis: DMs with 'Value First' get approximately thrice the number of responses compared to those without it.

This concise experiment setup ensures a straightforward assessment while aiming for rapid results and clear decision-making based on defined metrics.

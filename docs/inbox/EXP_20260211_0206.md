# Hypothesis Testing Experiment

## HYPOTHESIS
DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than DMs without this CTA.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of responses for each DM campaign (total and segmented by those containing the ‘Value First’ CTA).
2. Total number of impressions or views generated from these campaigns.
3. Campaign duration to ensure that time-related factors do not skew results significantly between groups with different CTAs ("Value First" vs standard text).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Run two sets (A and B) for an equal amount of campaign days, say 7 days each:
   - Set A: Standard DMs without the 'Value First' CTA.
   - Set B: Similar-looking but different content with a noticeable ‘Value First’ CTA inserted somewhere prominent.

2. Ensure that both campaigns run at similar times (daytime vs nighttime), targeting demographics and geographies as closely matched, if possible to remove bias related specifically to time or location factors from the results directly caused by 'Value First' CTAs.
   
3. Randomly assign new DMs into set A/B for 7 days of data collection.

4. Stop after collecting enough responses in both groups (use pre-experiment trials) such that we can achieve an accurate confidence interval with less than a week's worth collected under these conditions and still get statistically significant results - ideally, aim to reach around the halfway point before stopping this experiment so as not to lose valuable data points early on.

## METRIC
We need at least 80% (0.8) confident level that 'Value First' leads to an average increase of three times more replies compared with no CTA included in DMs for our fastest test under these conditions – i.e., CTR > X%, where the observed and expected difference is statistically significant based on a confidence interval we calculate.

## DECISION RULE
- If 80% (or higher) confident level shows that 'Value First' leads to at least three times more replies than no CTA, then continue with this as our validated hypothesis.
- Otherwise, reject H5: DMs with ‘Value First’ get thrice the reply rate. Adjust experiment design and rerun if needed.

# Note
This simplified approach ensures we can test quickly (within 7 days) but also gather enough data for a statistically valid conclusion on whether 'Value First' CTA is significantly effective in generating responses compared to standard DMs without any explicit CTAs.

# Hypothesis Testing Experiment for H3

## 1. Hypothesis
H3 states that "How-to" threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts on a given forum or website.

## 2. Evidence Required
To test this hypothesis, we need to collect the following data points:
- Total number of bookmark interactions (both received and made) for each thread.
- The type of post ('How-to' vs 'Why-to').
- Timestamps when bookmarks were added/subtracted if possible to analyze trends over time.

## 3. Fastest Experiment
A quick experiment would involve selecting a sample period, say one week:
1. Randomly select two samples: One for "How-to" threads and another matching in size from the 'Why-to' category.
2. Record bookmark counts during this interval separately by post type ('How-to', 'Why-to').

## 4. Metric
We are interested specifically if there is a statistically significant difference between bookmarks received on average per thread:
- Bookmarks for "How-to" threads: X (Number of Bookmark Interactions)
- Bookmarks for "Why-to": Y (Number of Bookmark Interactions)

The desired outcome would be that the mean number of bookmark interactions in 'How-to' posts is greater than those observed with a confidence level higher than 80%.

## 5. Decision Rule
If **X > Y + margin** and this difference holds true beyond sampling errors, we conclude "H3" has strong support.

Here are some concrete numbers:
- If the mean bookmark interaction per 'How-to' post is significantly greater (more by at least a threshold) than that of any observed sample from ‘Why-to’, it supports H3.
For example: A 20% difference in bookmarks would be our margin for quick confidence, i.e., if X > Y + 0.2Y.

**If:** Bookmark counts per 'How-to' post are consistently greater compared to a matched group of 'Why-to' posts by at least the determined percentage (e.g., mean(X) - mean(Y)).
**Then:**
H3 is supported, indicating "How-to" threads indeed receive more bookmarks. 

Note that this quick experiment may need further validation through repeated sampling and larger sample sizes for stronger evidence but provides a preliminary test of H3.

# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## HYPOTHESIS
H1: Posting at peak working hours captures US West Coast engineers.

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- **Data Points Needed**:

  - Number of clicks on posts made during different time slots (e.g., early morning, lunchtime).
  - Engagement metrics such as likes and shares for each post.
  - Demographic information about the individuals who engaged with these posts to ensure they are US West Coast engineers.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- **Smallest Test**: Run an A/B test over a weekend (Saturday-Sunday) where:
  
  * Group A receives notifications at peak working hours for their region, e.g., mid-morning and afternoon.
  * Group B does not receive any notification during this time.

---

### METRIC:
- The key metric to watch is the **Click-through Rate (CTR)** compared across different times of day. For example:

  - CTR > X% when posting at peak working hours vs < Y% otherwise, where we want to achieve an increase in engagement by a specific threshold percentage.
  
---

### DECISION RULE:
- If our experimental data shows that the click-through rate for Group A (posts made during their region's workday) is statistically significantly higher than Group B with 80% confidence level or more (**p-value < 0.20**), then:

  - **Conclusion Y:** Posting at peak working hours effectively captures US West Coast engineers.
  
- If the click-through rate for both groups does not differ meaningfully, we can conclude that posting time is less critical than previously thought.

---

### Summary

This experiment tests if targeting posts during workday times increases engagement specifically from American tech professionals on social media platforms. The results will help determine optimal post timing to maximize visibility and interaction among this demographic group.

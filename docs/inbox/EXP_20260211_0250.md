## HYPOTHESIS:
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. **Click-through rate (CTR)** of posts made between the hours of midnight and early morning (e.g., UTC-7 to UTC+0) specifically targeting users from US cities located on the western coast.
  
2. User engagement metrics such as likes, shares, comments for those targeted time slots.

3. Geo-location data confirming that engagements come predominantly or exclusively from West Coast locations in real-time post and click-through analysis.


## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
Set up a controlled A/B test using social media platforms like Twitter:

- **Control Group (A)**: Posts scheduled at 10 AM Pacific Time.
  
- **Test Group (B)**: Posts scheduled exactly to be posted around midnight Pacific Time, adjusted for server timezones.

Measure and compare the engagement metrics mentioned above between these two groups over a short period of one week.


## METRIC:
Click-through rate (**CTR**) > 2% in Test group compared with Control group. The smaller margin indicates that postings at 2 AM are specifically capturing US West Coast engineers as opposed to other time slots.

Another relevant metric could be the **engagement percentage** (likes, shares) during this hour versus non-targeted hours.


## DECISION RULE:
If `CTR` for Test Group B is significantly greater than CTR of Control Group A by more than 2%, then HYPOTHESIS can potentially hold true. If not significant beyond a threshold value or if engagement metrics don’t support the hypothesis, we reject it.

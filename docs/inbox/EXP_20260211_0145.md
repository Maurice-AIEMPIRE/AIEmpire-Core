# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
*H1*: Posting at 10 PM captures US West Coast engineers better than posting at other times.

**Note:** To test the original hypothesis ("Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers."), this experiment focuses on testing a different but related time (10 PM) for its effectiveness in capturing users interested specifically from regions such as California, Oregon and Washington - typically considered part of North America's Pacific Time Zone. Adjustments can be made if targeting the specific region.

## 1. EVIDENCE REQUIRED

To test this hypothesis rigorously:
- **Time-Based Data Points**: User engagement metrics (clicks) at different times for posts targeted to US West Coast engineers.
    - Posts with no time specified as a baseline
    - Group A: Posted content aimed specifically targeting interest around the Pacific Time Zone, focusing on California-based events or news between 10 PM and midnight PT.

- **User Engagement Metrics**:
    - Click-through rate (CTR) for posts targeted at these times.
    - Number of interactions such as likes/comments/share/deliveries from users identified to be in US West Coast regions specifically during the targeting window. This can involve IP geolocation checks but would ideally require user consent and anonymized data collection.

## 2. FASTEST EXPERIMENT

- **Sample Size**: A smaller test involving approximately a week of targeted posts, with at least ten (10) different times around PT to compare against no time specified baseline.
    - Each post is shared by the same content creator/user/group across multiple platforms focusing on US West Coast engineers.

## 3. METRIC

- **Click-through rate for region-specific targeting**: CTR should ideally show an increase of at least +5% compared with a non-time targeted control group and benchmark against no time specified baseline.
    - Fastest confidence level reached by day three (7 days).

## 4. DECISION RULE

If the Click-Through Rate (CTR) for posts targeting US West Coast engineers around PT times is significantly higher (+10%) than both:
1. No-time-specified post group
2. Non-targeted baseline time group (e.g., daytime hours)

Then, we can infer that Targeting specific regions at certain times increases user engagement among the targeted demographic.

## 5. FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

If hypothesis H1 is confirmed:

- Analyze why these posts are more engaging: Is it due to content relevancy? Timing alignment with user's peak activity periods?
- Optimize post timings and frequency based on findings for each platform.
- Test extended geographical targeting (e.g., Canada, Hawaii) around PT time slots.

**Note:** This experiment aims at a preliminary testing stage. Further investigation should involve expanding the sample size over different weeks/months to confirm results across various timescales/cycles of engineering work patterns and holidays/special events among US West Coast engineers.

# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
- **H0:** Aggressive copy does not convert better than polite copy (i.e., conversion rates are the same for both).
- **Ha:** Aggressive copy converts at least 20% better than polite copy.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED: What data points do we need?
To test this hypothesis, we'll collect:
1. Conversion rate of aggressive copies.
2. Conversion rate of polite copies (control group).

Specifically,
- Number of visitors who receive the aggressive ad (`N_aggressive`).
- Number of clicks on that aggression copy (`Clicks_aggressive` = `Conversion_rate * N_aggressive`).
- Total number of ads shown with an aggressive tone (`Total_ad_Aggressive_tone`).

Similarly, for polite copies:
1. Conversion rate from politeness.
2. Control group data collection similar to above.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest test to get 80% confidence
### Calculation (using a simplified binomial distribution approach):

To achieve an 80% power with two groups of conversion rates, assuming equal sample size `n` for both:

1. Desired effect is d = Conversion_rate_Aggressive - Conversion_rate_Polite = \(20\%\)
2. Standard deviation estimated by pooled standard deviations (`pooled_std`) from previous samples.
3. Sample sizes can be derived using power analysis formulas.

Given the desired difference (d) and a significance level of α=0.05 for two-tailed test, we calculate:
- Effect size `Z = d / pooled_std`.
  
Using an online sample calculator or software like R/pwr package:

```r
library(pwr)
p <- 1 - pwr::power(aov(Conversion_rate_Aggressive ~ Conversion_rate_Polite), 
                     aev("d"), alpha=0.05, power=t) # d = effect size needed for target confidence level.
sample_size_per_group <- ceiling(sample_n())
```

Sample sizes per group required might be around 500 to achieve this.

## 4. METRIC: Exact number to watch (e.g., CTR > 2%)
- Aggressive Copy Conversion Rate (`Conversion_rate_Aggressive`).
  
We compare the conversion rate of aggressive copy against polite copies directly:
1. **Aggressive Conversion Rate:** `(Clicks_aggressive / Total_ad_Aggressive_tone) * 100`
2. Set target threshold: `60% + margin = X%

## 5. DECISION RULE
- If Aggressive Copy Conversion Rate > Polite Copy Conversion Rate + (20%), then H1 is supported.
- Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

**Example Decision Rule in R/Python Pseudocode**
```python
def decision_rule(aggressive_conversion_rate, polite_conversion_rate):
    threshold = 0.2 * polite_conversion_rate # Convert to percentage

    if aggressive_conversion_rate > polite_conversion_rate + threshold:
        return "H1 is supported"
    else:
        return "Fail to reject H0"

# Example use
decision_result = decision_rule(aggressive_conversions, polite_conversions)
print(decision_result) 
```

With this structure and metric in mind: the experiment would be able to determine if aggressive copy indeed performs significantly better (at least 20% more effective than politely worded copies).

# Rigorous Experiment for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS:
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies compared to DMs without the phrase."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

1. Number of responses (replies) received from DM messages containing "Value First."
2. Total number of such DM messages sent.
3. The same metrics for a control group: total number and response rate of similar DM messages that do not contain "Value First" but are otherwise comparable in terms of content, target audience demographics etc.

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

1. Send out 300 DMs with 'Value First' to your targeted demographic.
2. Concurrently send another set (e.g., a different batch) - also totaling around 100 responses expected – without the phrase "Value First" but comparable in other aspects as much as possible, aiming for about similar response rates and total messages sent.

## METRIC:

1. Response rate with 'Value First' = Total Responses / Number of DMs Sent
2. Baseline (control) group: Same metric measured.
3. The comparison is between these two metrics to check if the former exceeds thrice as much compared to latter – essentially, a 300% increase in response rates for messages containing "Value First" over those that don't.

## DECISION RULE:

1. If Response Rate with 'Value First' > Baseline + 3 * Baseline.
2. Otherwise: The evidence does not support the hypothesis sufficiently; further investigation needed or consider modifying/hypothesizing anew based on initial findings and constraints of experiment design.

**Important Note:** This is a simplified model, actual experiments might need to factor in additional complexities like varying response rates across different segments (age groups etc.), diminishing returns with increased messages sent. Also bear in mind limitations such as time frames for responses & how quickly the DM traffic can be adjusted based on ongoing results.

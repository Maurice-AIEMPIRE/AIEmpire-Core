## HYPOTHESIS

**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.
  
## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
  
We need the following data points to test this hypothesis:
1. Total number of posts tagged as "how-to" and total bookmark counts received for these.
2. Total number of posts tagged as "why-to" and total bookmark counts received for these.

Additionally, we may want to collect metadata such as post age (time since creation), length of the content in words or characters, author popularity metrics like follower count if applicable:
- Number of 'how-to' threads with their respective bookmarks.
- Number of 'why-to' threads with their respective bookmarks.
  
## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
  
To get 80% confidence for our hypothesis quickly:

1. Select a sample size that statistically represents the total number of both types ("how-to" and "why-to").
2. Randomly select posts tagged as either “how-to” or “why-to”.
3. Track bookmarks received over one week (to control time-related factors).

Example: 
- 500 randomly selected 'how-to' threads.
- 500 randomly selected 'why-to' threads.

## METRIC
  
We will use the following metrics to compare:
1. The average number of bookmarks per post for "how-to" vs. "why-to".
2. Standard deviation in bookmark counts between both categories (to assess variance).

Exact numbers we should be looking at:

- **Bookmark Count Per Post**: Mean Bookmark Counts.
  - H3 requires that the mean bookmarking rate for 'How-To' threads must significantly exceed those of 'Why-To'.

## DECISION RULE
  
If:
1. The average bookmark count per post in "how-to" category is greater than twice (X > Y) or other statistical significance threshold set after performing a t-test.
2. Standard deviation between bookmarks counts are not excessively different.

Then, we conclude that **H3** holds true: 'How-To' threads get more bookmarks compared to 'Why-To'.

If the conditions for significant bookmark count difference in point 1 do NOT hold (X <= Y), then H3 does not prove.

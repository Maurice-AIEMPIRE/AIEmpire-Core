# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis:
- **H1**: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

## Evidence Required:

To test this hypothesis rigorously and achieve an 80% confidence level in the results quickly (within two weeks), we need to collect data on conversion rates. The evidence needed includes historical performance metrics of aggressive vs. polite copies for similar products or services, ideally with a sufficiently large sample size that represents different markets/countries/genres/content.

## Fastest Experiment:

- **Sample Size**: 100 A/B tests - split evenly between the two types (aggressive and polite).
- Each test should run simultaneously to avoid time-related biases.
- The duration of each test would be set for a short period, ideally within one week per group; however it can stretch up to about ten days total if needed.

## Metric:

We will track conversion rates as our primary metric. For aggressive copy vs polite ones (both versions should already have established baseline performance data), we'll look at the following metrics:
- Click-through rate (CTR): Should be significantly higher for one over another.
- Conversion Rate: Directly correlates with success in this context.

## Decision Rule:

If **aggressive copies** achieve a conversion rate 20% better than polite ones, then H1 is supported. An exact number can depend on the baseline performance data of your product/service and its industry standards; however it would be something like:
- Polite copy CTR > x%.
- Aggressive copy CTR = (Polite Copy CTR + 0.2 * Polite Copy CTR)%

If aggressive copies don't achieve a significantly better conversion rate than polite ones, then we reject H1.

*Note: The exact figures may depend on several factors such as the product/service industry and baseline performance metrics.*

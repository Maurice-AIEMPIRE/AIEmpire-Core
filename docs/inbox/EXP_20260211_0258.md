## Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis effectively and quickly with an **80% confidence level**, we need the following data points:

1. The total number of posts categorized as either "How-to" or "Why-to".
2. Number of bookmarked items in each category ("How-to" vs "Why-to").
3. Total user engagement (likes, comments) for both categories to normalize our results.
4. Timeframe over which the data is collected.

---

### Fastest Experiment:
**Small Test:** A quick test that can give us an 80% confidence level should ideally run within a week or less and involve fewer than **500 posts in total**, split evenly between "How-to" and "Why-to". This sample size ensures enough variability to provide statistically significant insights.

---

### Metric:
The primary metric we'll monitor is the bookmark rate, defined as:

**Bookmark Rate = (Number of Bookmarks / Total Posts) * 100%**

We need a **bookmark count difference ≥10% between 'How-to' vs. 'Why-to'.**

---

### Decision Rule:
If "How-to" threads have at least an additional **10% bookmark rate over the 'Why-to'" category, then we can conclude that H3 is supported.

**DECISION RULE: IF (Bookmark Rate of How-to) ≥ 110%, THEN Conclude H3; ELSE NOT CONCLUDE**

This experiment design provides a structured approach to testing our hypothesis with minimal resources while still aiming for significant results.

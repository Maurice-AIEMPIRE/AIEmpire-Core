# Experimental Design for Testing the Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than DMs without it."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. **Number of Replies (with and without "Value First")**:
   - Count total number of responses received from each DM that includes or omits the phrase "Value First".
2. **Time Stamps for Responses**
3. **Contextual Data Points: User Behavior, Engagement Levels**

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Prepare two sets of DMs (one with and one without 'Value First').
   - Use a similar context to ensure consistency.
2. Send the same number (~100) from both groups at comparable times.

**Timeline for 80% Confidence Level:**
- Short-term engagement window, say within first hour post-DM sending time frame.

## METRIC
"Total Replies per DM."

### Target Metric:
1 **With 'Value First' (Group A)** should get more than three replies.
2. Baseline Group B without "Value First".
3. Statistical threshold set at 80% confidence level for result validation and comparability.

**Calculation Formula:**
- If X = Average Replies per DM with ‘ValueFirst’
   - Y > X + 0.8*X (Threshold should be above three times baseline)

## DECISION RULE
1 **If** average replies from DMs containing 'Value First' are more than triple the responses received by those without it, then conclude that hypothesis is true.
2 If not greater, conclusion would indicate there’s no significant difference supporting H5.

### Implementation Steps:
- Randomize DM recipients within each group to avoid bias and ensure equal visibility opportunities across both groups (Control Group B for baseline).
1. Send 100 DMs with 'ValueFirst' phrase.
   - Simultaneously send another set of equivalent context, but without mentioning the term "Value First" as Control.

2. Track responses in real-time via a CRM tool or database logging system to gather quick feedback on engagement levels per DM group (A and B).
3. After 1 hour window post-DM sending for both groups:
   - Analyze total replies received.
4. Calculate average number of messages sent back using the formula above.

### Post-experiment Analysis
- Statistical testing like chi-square or t-test to confirm if differences observed are statistically significant supporting hypothesis H5 with an acceptable confidence interval (80%).
1. Report findings in a structured format, highlighting metrics comparison between both groups and drawing conclusion on whether "Value First" phrase significantly impacts engagement as per hypothesized results.

### Conclusion
- If the experiment confirms that DMs containing 'ValueFirst' get at least three times more replies than those without it with 80% confidence level - H5 is supported.
- Should not meet this criteria, consider alternate reasons (e.g., phrasing differences unrelated to value proposition) or re-evaluate experimental design for potential improvements.

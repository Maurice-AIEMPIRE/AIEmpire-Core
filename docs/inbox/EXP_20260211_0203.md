# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
"H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

- Conversion rate of aggressive copies (CR_A): The percentage of users who complete the desired action after seeing an aggressive call-to-action.
- Conversion rate of polite copies (CR_P): The same metric for those receiving a less direct, more courteous prompt.

We need to collect sufficient data points from both CR_A and CR_P across similar conditions such as audience demographics, content type, etc., until we can detect the 20% difference with high confidence. We also aim at achieving an overall sample size that allows us reaching our desired level of certainty (80%).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

- **Sample Size Calculation**: Assuming a conservative conversion rate for both types and aiming to achieve significance in detecting a minimum detectable effect, we can utilize power analysis tools or statistical software packages like R's `pwr` package. Setting alpha=0.05, 1-beta (power)=0.8 suggests needing roughly 70 subjects per group.
- **Experiment Setup**: Randomly split incoming web visitors into two equal groups - one exposed to aggressive copy and the other polite copy – ensuring they are comparable in terms of demographics or time spent on site before showing them their respective copies.

## METRIC:

"Conversion rate difference between CR_A and CR_P should be > 20%."

This metric directly measures our hypothesis' validity. If we can observe this threshold consistently across repeated experiments, it significantly supports H1 over the null hypothesis (H0).

## DECISION RULE:

"If conversion rates show more than a 20% increase for aggressive copies compared to polite ones in at least two out of three independent tests with an adequate sample size (>70 per group), then we can conclude that 'Aggressive copy converts better' is significantly supported over the null hypothesis."

**Note: This simplified experiment design focuses on achieving clarity and brevity. Real-world experiments might require additional considerations such as ethical standards, user consent for behavioral studies (where applicable) or adjustments based on preliminary results before scaling up to larger sample sizes.

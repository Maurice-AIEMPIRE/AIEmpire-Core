# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS:
H3 states that "How-to" threads receive more bookmarks than 'Why-to' posts.

1. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**:

   To test this hypothesis accurately and effectively through an experiment, we need the following data points to be collected from a significant sample of web pages or forums where both types of content exist:
   
   - The number of times each type ("How-to" vs "Why-to") is bookmarked.
   - Total posts made for comparison: How many total bookmarks are received by 'How-to' and how many by 'Why-to'.
   - Demographic information about the users who bookmark these threads (optional, but useful to control variables).
   
2. **FASTEST EXPERIMENT**:

   The fastest experiment would involve creating a small sample of both "How-to" posts and corresponding "Why-to" ones on platforms with high traffic like Reddit or Quora.
   
   - Select 10 'How-to' threads that are similar in subject matter to their respective 'Why-to'.
   - Track the number of bookmarks for each thread over one week.

3. **METRIC**:

   The metric we will monitor closely is:
   
   `Bookmark Count Ratio (BCR)`: Number of Bookmarks per Post Type.
   
   For example, if a "How-to" post receives 150 bookmarks and its paired 'Why-to' gets only 60 over the week-long observation period.

4. **DECISION RULE**:

    - If BCR > X: Conclude that there is strong evidence to support H3 (i.e., How-to threads get more bookmarks than Why-to).
    
   Here, you would define `X` based on a confidence interval or statistical significance threshold for your test.
   
## Example Decision Rule

If the average bookmark count per 'How-to' post exceeds 1.5 times that of an equivalent 'Why-to', then we can conclude with high certainty (e.g., >80% CI) H3 is supported.

Note: Actual values and confidence thresholds would depend on preliminary data analysis to determine statistical significance.


**Additional Considerations**

- Randomize the selection process for thread types.
- Ensure a diverse set of topics within 'How-to' threads but similar enough in subject matter as their respective 'Why-to'.
- Repeat this experiment across different platforms with high user interaction and engagement levels.

By closely monitoring these metrics, we can gain insights into whether H3 is statistically significant or if further investigation would be needed.

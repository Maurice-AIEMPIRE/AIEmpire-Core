# Experimental Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
"H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy."

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
We need the following data points:
- The conversion rate (CR) of both aggressive and polite copies. Conversion rates are typically measured as a percentage.

### Data Points to Gather per Sample Size n for Each Copy Type:

| Type       | Number of Samples (n) | Total Conversions Needed |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Aggressive | 100                    | X1                       |
| Polite     | 100                    | X2                       |

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
To get an 80% confidence interval, we can use the sample size for both aggressive and polite copies. According to power analysis principles (typically using software like G*Power or conducting a preliminary test), assume:
- Alpha level = 0.05,
- Power = 0.8.

Based on these parameters:

1. **Sample Size Calculation:**
   - Use formulas derived from normal approximation for proportions.
   
2. Assuming equal sample sizes, use conservative estimates to simplify calculations (e.g., P_Aggressive ≈ CR + margin of error).

3. Example Calculations:
   - For aggressive copy with a rough expected conversion rate = 25%,
     n=100 gives us around X1 ~ approximately 0.2*X for an estimated result.
     
4. Conduct preliminary tests or simulations to confirm the required sample sizes.

## METRIC
The key metric is "Conversion Rate (CR)" and we need:
- CR_Aggressive > P_polite + margin

For a significant difference of at least X% better conversion, our threshold should be set as follows: 

| Metric                        | Aggressive Copy  | Polite Copy     |
|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Conversion Rate (CR)          | ≥ expected rate with confidence interval |

## DECISION RULE
If the observed CR for aggressive copy is significantly higher than polite conversion rates by X%, conclude "H1: Aggressive copies convert better."

### Decision Rule in Practice:

Assume we run tests on n=100 samples per type, and observe:
- Mean Conversion Rate of Polite Copy (P_polite) = 5%
- Standard Deviation (σ)

Let Y be the observed conversion rate for aggressive copy.

Decision rule: If P_Aggressive > mean(Polite + X margin), then conclude H1 is supported. 

Example Decision Threshold:

If we set a minimum difference of 2% with confidence, thus our decision criteria would look like this:
- If CR(Aggressive) - CR(Polite)>0.02 (or Y>7%), confirm better conversion rate for aggressive copy.

By following these guidelines and using accurate statistical tools to monitor conversions over the sample size n=100 per type/copy style, we can confidently test H1 with an 80% confidence level.

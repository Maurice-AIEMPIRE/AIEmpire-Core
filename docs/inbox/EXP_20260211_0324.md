## Hypothesis:
"H5: DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies compared to those without."

---

### Evidence Required:

1. Number of DM responses received for messages that contain the phrase "Value First."
2. Total number of such DMs sent.
3. Comparison group consisting equally composed sample size containing similar DMs but lacking a specific prompt like 'Value First.'

---

### Fastest Experiment:
- Send 300 targeted text direct marketing (TDM) emails featuring different prompts, including some with the phrase "Value First."
  
*Note:* The chosen number of samples should be statistically significant to get an estimate at around 80% confidence. A power analysis may help determine this sample size.

---

### Metric:

Number of replies per DM as a response rate metric (i.e., total Replies/Total DMs).

**Target:** At least double the reply rates for 'Value First' compared to other prompts, aiming toward three times higher responses within our 80% confidence interval. If not achievable in one attempt due to constraints or lack of statistical significance at first sample count, this becomes a two-stage process with retesting after increasing initial samples (if time allows), as necessary.

---

### Decision Rule:

If the response rate for DMs containing 'Value First' is significantly higher compared to other similar prompts (> 2x baseline responses) within our confidence interval boundaries, we accept H5. Else, reject it.

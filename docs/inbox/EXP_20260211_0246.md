## Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

## Evidence Required:
1. Number of posts tagged as "how-to".
2. Number of bookshelves (bookmarks) in each post tagged with both categories ("how-to" and "why-to").
3. Total number of users engaging by bookmarking for the respective tags.

## Fastest Experiment
A quick A/B test on a popular coding forum or blog site where posts are randomly assigned to either 'How-to' or 'Why-to', tracking bookmarks over 2 weeks until reaching an estimated sample size that yields at least 80% confidence in results. Assuming uniform user engagement, this could involve observing the bookmarking behavior of around 400-500 unique users divided equally among both categories.

## Metric
The primary metric is **the ratio** between total book-marked posts for 'how-to' versus those bookmarked as a result from 'why-to'. The expected outcome would be that H3 holds true if this observed ratio exceeds the threshold indicative of significantly higher bookmarking rates in one category over another (e.g., 1.5 or greater).

## Decision Rule
- If **the total number of bookmarks for posts tagged with "how-to" is at least X% more than those bookmarked from tags labeled as 'why-to'**, then H3 holds true.
  
Note: The decision rule should use a statistical confidence interval to ensure that the observed difference in bookmarking rates isn't due purely to chance. A common practice would be using an 80-90% Confidence Interval (CI) which, for this type of data analysis might look like "the lower bound is at least X%. If it falls below Y%, H3 cannot confidently hold true." 

For example:
- Decision rule: if the number of bookmarks from 'how-to' threads exceeds those bookmarked as a result from tags labeled under ‘why-to’ by 15% or more, then we can be confident (at an 80% CI) that this trend is statistically significant and not merely due to random chance.

This experiment design provides for quick feedback with relatively low costs in terms of time resources required. Moreover it allows us the flexibility needed when designing experiments on popular platforms where you would need permission before tagging all posts.

# Experiment Design for Testing the Hypothesis "Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
**H4:** Memes containing code snippets will spread through social media platforms (e.g., Twitter) at a significantly higher rate compared to memes without code.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED

To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points:

- **Meme Type:**
  - Group A: Meme with embedded or linked code snippet.
  - Group B: Similar meme format but containing no coding content (images/text descriptions only).

- **Engagement Metrics for Each Post over Time**:
  - Likes
  - Retweets/shares/copies/other engagement metrics as applicable to the social media platform being used.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT

Create two sets of memes: one containing code snippets and another with no coding content, ensuring both are similar in style (humor level) but differ only by presence or absence of a snippet.
  
1. Post them across various platforms like Twitter using different timeslots to avoid skewed results due to time-of-day effects.

2. Track the engagement metrics for each post over an initial period equivalent to 80% confidence interval estimation, ideally around one week (though shorter durations can be tested iteratively).

## 4. METRIC

Measure:
- Number of retweets/shares/copies per meme within a specified timeframe.
  
Target Metric: 
- Average rate increase in engagement metrics for Group A memes compared with those from Group B must exceed the baseline viral spread.

For instance, aim to show that **Group A's mean number of shares +1** more than doubles (e.g., if average share count without code is X, we need at least Y = 2X+10) within one week after posting for a statistically significant result with high confidence (>80%).

## 5. DECISION RULE

- If Group A memes receive on average **at least twice the shares/copies as compared to Group B over an initial testing period** (e.g., X days), then H4 is supported.

### Example Decision Rule in Practice:

```markdown
If, by day 3 post release:
Average retweets/shares of code snippet meme > double the baseline average without snippets +10% margin.
Then conclude: Memes with embedded/code links/videos spread significantly faster on social media platforms compared to non-code memes (80% confidence level).
```

This setup ensures a rigorous test for H4 while providing clear, measurable evidence. Adjustments can be made based upon preliminary data analysis and refined through iterative testing cycles if initial results indicate further exploration is warranted.

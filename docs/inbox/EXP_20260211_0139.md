## HYPOTHESIS
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. Number of posts made exactly at midnight (local time) on the East and West Coasts over a specified period for each day when posting was intended to reach both coasts.
   - Total number of post engagements from these exact-millisecond postings across different days/times
2. Engagement metrics like likes, shares/retweets/comments.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
1. Create an account with the ability to automatically publish posts at 12 AM EST (00:00) and record its engagement.
   - Conduct this experiment for a minimum of one week on both East Coast Daylight Time (EDT; UTC-4h in July-August, Eastern Standard Time or Central & Mountain time zone depending upon daylight saving times).
2. Record the number of US West Coast users who engaged with these posts through their Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter accounts.

### METRIC:
1. Number of post engagements from East coast postings vs western (UTC-7h to UTC) - 100% engagement.
   - The metric is "Number of likes, shares/comments on our automatic midnight-posts".

2. Percent change in US West Coast user interactions compared with the usual posting time.

### DECISION RULE:
1. If X = Percentage increase or decrease > ±20%, then Y: Confirming hypothesis that 2 AM posts attract more users from west coast.
   - Post engagement metrics for both east and west coasts (e.g., likes, shares) are greater than previous engagements observed at different hours of the day.

### Fastest Experiment:
1. Daytime post on East Coast as control group + Night-time post at 12 AM EST / PST
2. Record how many US West Coast users engage with posts posted during this time.
3. Repeat for a week and record data to calculate percentage increase/decrease in engagement metrics (likes, shares/comments) compared to the previous hours.

### Fastest Decision Rule:
1. If there is > 20% difference between Daytime vs Night-time post engagements on US West Coast users then Y: Confirming hypothesis that posts posted at night capture more engineers from west coast.
2. Otherwise X = No significant change detected, leading us not to confirm our original H2.

### Notes
- This experiment should be repeated multiple times for increased confidence in the results (80% or higher).
- Consideration of factors such as holidays/festivities and weekend vs weekdays when conducting this test is important.
- To increase accuracy further we would also need feedback data from US West Coast engineers themselves.

## Hypothesis:
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

### Evidence Required
- Number of "how-to" and "why-to" posts in a given period (e.g., daily/monthly).
- The number of times each post receives a bookmark.
- Total traffic to the respective categories ("how-to" vs. "why-to").

### Fastest Experiment:
Create 100 new threads labeled as either 'How-To' or 'Why-To', randomly assign them, and track how many bookmarks they receive over one week.

#### Steps for One Week:

1. Create a total of **50** posts in each category ('how-to' vs 'why-to').
2. Randomly distribute these across various topics within the categories to avoid bias.
3. Track every bookmark received by both types during this period (e.g., daily).
4. Record traffic data such as views, likes and comments for additional context.

### Metric:
We need an 80% confidence level on a metric that measures bookmarks per post type difference over time:

- The average number of bookmarks per "how-to" thread vs the 'why-to' threads during this period.
  
#### Decision Rule
If H3 is true, we expect to see statistically significant higher bookmark counts for each individual new "How-To" posts compared with an equivalent randomly assigned set of newly created and tracked “Why-To” blog entries.

Example decision rule: If average bookmarks per 'how-to' post > 20% + margin-of-error than the respective mean from the same period's ‘why-to’ threads, we conclude that H3 is true.

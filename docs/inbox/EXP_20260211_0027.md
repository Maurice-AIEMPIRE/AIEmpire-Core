# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster."

## 1. HYPOTHESIS:
Memes containing embedded code snippets spread more quickly and widely online compared to memes without such content.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:

To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points for both groups of memes (with and without code snippets):

- **Creation Date**: The date when each meme was created.
- **Share Count/Spread Rate**: Number of shares or reposts within a specific timeframe across different social media platforms at regular intervals post creation. Preferably, daily counts over the initial week to track immediate spread.
- **Engagement Metrics per Share/Post (likes/comments/shares)**: Average engagement metrics for each share/post in both groups.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT:

The quickest experiment would involve creating two identical memes—one with a code snippet and one without—and posting them simultaneously across multiple social media platforms to ensure uniformity of initial visibility conditions such as audience reach, time zone spread etc., over the first week specifically observing share count/spread rate.

## 4. METRIC:
We will monitor **daily average increase in shares** for each meme type (with vs. without code snippet) and track if there's a statistically significant difference between them by day-end of that period to ensure we achieve at least an 80% confidence level using T-tests or ANOVA across the days.

## 5. DECISION RULE:
- **If daily average increase in shares for memes with embedded code snippets is significantly higher than those without (p < 0.05), then accept H4**.
  
This would be followed by a validation experiment to confirm consistency of results over different platforms and audience demographics if initial findings are promising.

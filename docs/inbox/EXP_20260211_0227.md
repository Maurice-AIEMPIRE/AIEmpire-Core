# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
1. Number of posts made exactly at 2 AM on the US West Coast (California).
2. Engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares.
3. Demographic data to confirm whether those engaged are from California and work in engineering fields like software development or IT services.

### Fastest Experiment: Smallest test to get an 80% confidence level
- **Sample Size**: Determine a sample size based on historical posting times; e.g., if historically only X posts happen at this time, take half of it (X/2).
- Conduct targeted social media advertisements or sponsored content with the same characteristics but timestamped exactly at 2 AM.
  
### Metric to Watch
1. Engagement rate > x% (e.g., likes + comments/shares ratio) compared against historical average engagement rates for similar posts not made at this time.

#### Decision Rule: If X, then Y

- **X** = Post engagements from US West Coast engineers are significantly higher (>x%) than the control group.
- **Y** = Hypothesis confirmed; hence posting content specifically timed to 2 AM effectively captures interest of engineering professionals on that coast.

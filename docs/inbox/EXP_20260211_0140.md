# RIGOROUS Experiment for Hypothesis Testing

## HYPOTHESIS
"DMs with 'Value First' get three times more replies than DMs without this message."

---

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
1. **Number of Replies:** Total number of replies received on the initial DM (with and without "Value First").
2. **Time Elapsed Since Sending the Message**
3. **Content Analysis**: Whether or not 'Value First' was used in each respective group.

#### Additional Evidence for Robustness
4. Response Quality Scores.
5. Engagement Level Metrics like click-through rates if applicable, etc.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
- Run a controlled test where you send 10 DMs with "Value First" to similar targeted individuals and another set of 10 identical messages without the 'Value First' tag but otherwise matched in content type.
  
#### Note: The experiment duration should ideally be several hours or until replies cease significantly.

---

### METRIC:
- Number of Replies per DM

**Target Metric:** Achieve an average increase by a factor of **3x (90%) compared to non-'Value First' DMs.**

*Note:* Since the hypothesis suggests multiplying, use 10 as your benchmark for baseline responses; hence you aim at achieving approx *27 replies total on 'Value first' messages.*

---

### DECISION RULE:
- If average number of replies per DM in the "Value First" group is **at least** double that observed in non-'Value First’ DMs.
  
*Note:* This decision rule accounts for variances due to randomness and ensures a significant 80% confidence interval around results.*

## Hypothesis:
**H2:** Posting at 2 AM captures US West Coast engineers.

### Evidence Required
- Time of posts and corresponding engagement metrics (e.g., likes/comments/shares).
- Location data indicating the origin or location preferences for followers who engaged with these posts.
  
### Fastest Experiment: Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence

1. **Content Creation:** Create a set of social media post content targeted at US West Coast engineers and create two versions:
   - Version A (Control): Posted during typical peak hours, e.g., late afternoon/evening when most people are online.
   - Version B: Edited to appear as if posted around 2 AM.

2. **Posting Time:** Post both the control version and test version at their designated times over a short period such as one week (7 days).
   
3. **Data Collection Period & Sample Size Calculation**:
    To achieve an acceptable level of statistical significance, we calculate sample size using binomial proportion confidence interval formula for small samples.

### Metric: Exact Number to Watch
- CTR (> 2%): Click-through rate or engagement rate should be compared between the control (A) and test version B.
  
### Decision Rule:
1. **Calculate Engagement Rate** per post type at different times of day across all posts made during this period, i.e., total engagements divided by unique views for each category.

    - If CTR(A) <= 2% AND CTR(B)> 8%, then we accept H0 (null hypothesis that there is no difference in engagement).
  
### Conclusion:
If the test version B achieves an above-average or significantly higher click-through rate than control posts A, it implies engaging US West Coast engineers at around 2 AM captures their attention. Otherwise, conclude there's insufficient evidence to support posting times as a factor for capturing this demographic.

Note: Given limited resources and time constraints (small sample size), the test period is short but designed with statistical power in mind aiming toward achieving an overall confidence level of ~80%. Adjustments may be required based on observed variability or initial data trends.

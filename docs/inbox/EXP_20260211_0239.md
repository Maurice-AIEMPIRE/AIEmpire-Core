## Hypothesis
H1: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

---

### Evidence Required:
To test this hypothesis rigorously:

- Conversion rate for aggressive copies (percentage of recipients clicking on the link or taking some desired action after seeing an ad/promo).
- Conversion rate for polite copies.
  
These data points should be collected over a significant period to ensure statistical relevance and reliability. Ideally, these rates would also consider variables like demographic factors that could influence conversion.

---

### Fastest Experiment:
A split test (AB testing) with two groups:

1. **Group A**: Receives the aggressive copy
2. **Group B**: Receives a polite copy

Both copies are shown to random samples of your target audience on an equal basis for clarity and fairness in comparison.

---

### Metric(s):
- Conversion Rate = (Number of Conversions / Total Number of People Who Received Copy) * 100%
  
We need the conversion rate from each group. We aim to find a difference that is statistically significant with at least **80% confidence** using an appropriate statistical test like Z-test for proportions.

---

### Decision Rule:
- Conducting hypothesis testing (two-tailed), we'll determine if there's sufficient evidence by setting our significance level (`α`) typically around 0.05.
  
If the observed conversion rate difference between aggressive and polite copy falls outside a predefined confidence interval, we reject H1 in favor of confirming that one type does indeed convert better than another.

For instance:
- If **p-value < α**, there's sufficient evidence to conclude with at least an `80%` level of certainty.

### Example Decision Rule Format:

```
If the observed difference between conversion rates (Aggressive vs. Polite) is statistically significant, then aggressive copy converts better than polite copy.

| Conversion Rate Aggression - | p-value < 0.05: Yes

OR

If there's no statistical significance in differences,

| No conclusion can be drawn about which type of text leads to higher conversions.
```

### Summary:
In this structured approach:

1. Clearly state the hypothesis (H1).
2. Identify and collect necessary data points for robust comparison — conversion rates from aggressive vs polite copy campaigns over a specified period, across diverse samples if possible.

3. Implement an AB test split equally between both versions to maintain experimental integrity.
4. Monitor precise metrics like Conversion Rates with statistical testing aimed at achieving 80% confidence level through Z-tests on proportions (normal approximation).
5. Follow the decision rules based strictly upon observed p-values and predefined significance levels (`α`), ensuring conclusions are drawn only if evidence is statistically significant.

This rigorous methodology will provide a robust test of H1, enabling actionable insights for copywriting strategies.

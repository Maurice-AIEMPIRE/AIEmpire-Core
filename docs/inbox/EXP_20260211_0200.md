# Experimental Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS

## Hypothesis
H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

---

### Evidence Required:
1. Number of likes/shares/comments on memes containing only text vs those including a single line or block of executable code snippet within the first 24 hours.
2. The growth rate (number increase per hour) for both types over two days, three days etc., until there is significant viral spread.

---

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT:
* Use platforms like Reddit and Twitter to post memes with similar characteristics except one has a simple executable code snippet embedded in it while the other meme contains only text.
  - The type of codes included should also be consistent across both groups (e.g. all JavaScript snippets).
  * Track metrics for each group separately from posting times till you get at least X% increase per hour indicating viral spread over time.

---

### METRIC:
* Growth rate in the number of likes/shares/comments on memes with code snippet versus those without.
    - Target a significant difference (>X%) between meme groups to conclude H4 as true. For example, if Group A (with text only) has an average growth rate X% while group B (with one line or block of executable JavaScript embedded in it), shows Y% increase per hour after the first 24 hours.

---

### DECISION RULE:
* If there's a statistically significant difference (>X%) between memes with code snippets and those without, then H4 is accepted as true.

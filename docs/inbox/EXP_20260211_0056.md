# Experiment Design for Testing HYPOTHESIS

## Hypothesis
H0: DMs with 'Value First' do not get three times more replies compared to those without it.

Ha: DMs with 'Value First' receive 3x the number of responses as opposed to ones that don't have this phrase.


## Evidence Required:
- Count and record all direct messages (DMs) received over a defined period.
- Record whether each DM contained "Value First" or not ("V1").
- Log replies for every message, both with V1 and without it.

### Data Points Needed
- Total number of DMs analyzed: X total DM's

  - Number containing 'Value First' (X_v1): Y v1 messages

  - Responses received to each type:

    -- Messages not including "V1" had Z responses on average per message. 

    -- V1 contained messages averaged at aZ responses.


## Fastest Experiment
- Randomly sample X total DM's, ensuring an equal representation of those with and without 'Value First'.

  - Group them accordingly.

  - Record the number of replies for each group over this period


### Metric to Monitor:
Aim for more than triple response rate in V1 DMs compared to non-V1 messages. For example:

- Non-V1 average responses: X% per message

- Targeted increase with 'V1': At least Y times X%, or 3X%. (Y must be a value that provides at least an 80 percent confidence interval).


## Decision Rule
If the V1 group's response rate is more than triple compared to non-V1 groups, then we reject H0 and accept Ha; otherwise, do not reject Ha.

## Hypothesis
H3: 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'.

---

### Evidence Required:
1. Number of posts tagged as "how-to" and their corresponding bookmark counts over a specific time period (e.g., one month).
2. Number of posts tagged as "why-to" for the same set of data points.
3. Control variables such as post length, author popularity score at start-time, topic relevance to current events.

---

### Fastest Experiment:
1. Select two equally popular forums with active participation in a single field (e.g., programming).
2. Tag posts randomly over one month either "how-to" or "why-to".
3. Measure bookmark counts for these tagged threads daily.
4. Compare the average bookmarks per day between 'How-to' and 'Why-to'.

---

### Metric:
- A minimum increase of 20% more bookmarks in a given week on how-to posts compared to why-to.

---

### Decision Rule: If How-to has consistently shown at least a 20% higher bookmark count than Why-to, then H3 is confirmed. Otherwise not.

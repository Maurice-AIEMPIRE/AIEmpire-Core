# RIGOROUS Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
**H3:** 'How-to' threads get more bookmarks than 'Why-to'. 

## Evidence Required:
1. Number of posts tagged as "how-to".
2. Total number of unique users who bookmarked these how-to and why-to tags.
3. Average bookmark count per post for both categories.

## Fastest Experiment
- Select a popular community platform like Reddit or Stack Overflow that uses the same tagging system (i.e., 'how-to' vs. 'why-to').
- Identify 100 recent posts tagged as "how-to" with at least one bookmark.
- Randomly select another set of 50 most bookmarked and active posts from each tag category ('how-to', ‘why-to’).
- Ensure a time frame for data collection that covers the latest trends, e.g., past six months.

## Metric
1. **Total Bookmarks per Post:**
   - Track total bookmarks received by individual "how-to" threads.
2. **Average Bookmark Count Per Thread (How-To vs Why-To):** 
   - Calculate average number of bookmarks across 100 posts in each category separately to compare the mean bookmark counts.

## Decision Rule
- If `H3` is correct, then we expect that how-to topics will have a higher total and/or greater per-post averages than why-to threads.
  
Specifically:
1. **Total Bookmarks Per Post:** 
   - H3 should show significantly more bookmarks on "how-to" posts (e.g., mean bookmark count > 2% of the average post views).
   
## Detailed Metrics & Rules
- Compare metrics using a statistical test such as an independent t-test to establish if there is significant evidence supporting `H3`.
  
1. **Total Bookmarks Per Post:**
   - Test Hypothesis \( H_0 \): Mean bookmarks for how-to posts = mean bookmarks for why-to posts.
     vs Alternative hypothesis, \( Ha : \) Mean bookmarks for how-to posts > mean bookmarks for why-to posts.

2. **Average Bookmark Count per Thread (How-To vs Why-To):**
   - Compute means and standard deviations of the average bookmark counts in both categories to ensure statistically significant difference (> 95% confidence interval).

If after running statistical tests, if there is a p-value less than \( \alpha = 0.05\), reject H_0; thus we conclude `H3` holds true.

## Summary Table
| Metric                             | Value Target           |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Total Bookmarks Per Post (How-To)  | Mean > 2% of Views     |
| Average Bookmark Count per Thread (How-To vs Why-To)| H0: Equal, Ha: How-to > Why-to |

**If total bookmarks for how-to posts are significantly higher than those in why-to threads and average bookmark counts favor this hypothesis; we conclude `H3` holds true.**

## Conclusion
This experiment will validate whether 'how-to' tags lead to more bookmarking activity compared with the general informational purpose of a 'why-to'. With rigorous statistical analysis, confidence can be established on the validity of H3.

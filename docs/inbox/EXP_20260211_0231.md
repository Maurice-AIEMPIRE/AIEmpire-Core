# Hypothesis Testing Experiment for DM 'Value First' Effectiveness

## HYPOTHESIS
**H0:** DMs with the tag 'Value First' do not receive three times more replies compared to those without it.  
**Ha:** DMs with the tag 'Value First' get 3x as many replies.

---

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To test this hypothesis, we need two primary sets of data:

1. **Replies on value-first tagged DM campaigns:**
   - Number and size (e.g., text length) of responses.
2. **Replies from non-value-first DMs for comparison:** 
   - Same metrics as the above set.

---

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT
A small-scale A/B test can be conducted to gather initial data, with each group consisting:

- Group 1: Value First tagged messages (n=500).
- Group 2: Control group without 'Value First' tag or different variation for baseline comparison. (control n=1000).

The sample size should allow the experimenter to achieve an 80% confidence interval.

---

## METRIC
Primary metric - Average Number of Replies per DM:

**Target Metric:** For Ha, we need Group 1's average replies to be at least twice as high compared with baseline group (Group 2) responses.
- Threshold for a significant result: Group 1 > 3 * Baseline group's mean number of replies.

---

## DECISION RULE
If the observed metric in H1 significantly exceeds triple that from Ha, then we reject **H0** and conclude there's evidence supporting our hypothesis. Otherwise, there is insufficient data to confirm or refute it.
- Significance level (alpha): 5%

Remember this experiment only provides preliminary results which would need larger sample sizes for conclusive findings.

## Hypothesis
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts **20% better than polite copy**

---

### Evidence Required:
- Click-through rate (CTR) for aggressive and polite copies.

---

### Fastest Experiment:

Conduct a single A/B test with two versions of the same ad: one using an aggressive approach, another employing a more polite tone. The sample size should be sufficient to achieve 80% confidence levels based on previous CTR data or pilot studies showing variance in click-through rates between different copy approaches.

---

### Metric:
- **Click Through Rate (CTR)** for each version of the text.
  
**Target:** Achieve at least an additional 20% increase in CTR with aggressive copies over polite ones. For example, if a polite ad has a baseline CTR of X%, then we want to achieve *(X + X*0.2)* as CTR on the aggressive copy.

---

### Decision Rule:
- If (Aggressive Copy's CTR - Polite Copy's CTR) > 20% * ((Polite Copy’s Baseline CTR)/100), consider H1 supported.
- Else, reconsider or further test with different target audience segments/copies.

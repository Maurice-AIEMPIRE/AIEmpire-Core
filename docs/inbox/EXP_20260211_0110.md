# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis "H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster"

## 1. HYPOTHESIS
Memes containing programming language code snippets have a higher virality rate compared to memes without any embedded codes.

## 2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- **Sample Size (N):** A minimum of 500 meme posts on social media platforms like Twitter or Reddit.
- **Time Frame:** Track the spread over one week post-publication for consistency across viral metrics measurement period.
  
Data Points Needed:

1. Total number of shares, likes, and comments within seven days after a meme is posted (viral activity metric).
2. Whether each meme contains embedded code snippets in its content or not.

## 3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT
- **Meme Posting:** Post one million memes equally divided into two groups: 
    - Group A with embedded programming language codes.
    - Group B without any coding elements (control group).

Track the first three days to assess initial virality and then continue until seven total posts are tracked.

## 4. METRIC
- **Virality Metric:** Track metrics such as average number of shares, likes, comments per meme over a week after posting.
  
**Decision Threshold:**
If Group A (memes with code snippets) achieves an increase in the virality metric by at least twice that achieved from memes without codes compared to baseline within three days post-publication.

## 5. DECISION RULE
- **If:** Memes containing embedded programming language code achieve double or more viral activity metrics than those not including such elements (shares, likes/comments) after posting.
  
**Then:** Accept H4 as supported by the evidence collected and deemed statistically significant for a virality boost associated with memes embedding coding snippets.

# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

## Evidence Required 
- Number of shares on social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook)
- Time to first share after posting the meme 

## Fastest Experiment:
Create two memes related to programming humor or utility. Meme 1 will contain a humorous image without any text/code snippet and Meme 2 with an embedded code snippet as part of its design.
Post them simultaneously on three social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit) at around noon Eastern Standard Time for one week.

## Metric
Time taken from meme posting to first share - the shorter time indicates faster virality. Compare this metric between both memes across all postings and calculate average values per platform.


The experiment will have a decision rule as follows: If Meme 2 (with code snippet) has an earlier or similar sharing velocity compared to Meme 1, then H4 is accepted; otherwise rejected.

A preliminary analysis of the collected data could give us results quickly. Analyzing this small dataset with appropriate statistical tools should provide up to around a 70-80% confidence level regarding our hypothesis if we get enough consistent observations in favor or against it.

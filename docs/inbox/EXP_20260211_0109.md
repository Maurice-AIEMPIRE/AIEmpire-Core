## Hypothesis
H4: Memes with code snippets go viral faster.

---

### Evidence Required:
1. **Baseline engagement** for memes without code (e.g., likes, shares).
2. **Engagement metrics** over time for both categories of meme posts - those containing and not containing code.
3. **Time-to-viral point**, defined as the median day by which a post reaches its peak viral status.

### Fastest Experiment:
Create two groups each with 1 million social media users randomly assigned (using platforms like Twitter, Reddit).

**Group A:**
Posts memes without any content or text but solely rely on humor and aesthetics.
- Track engagements for these posts over the first week to gather baseline data. This ensures that we have a control group.

**Group B:**
Create memes similar in format as Group A; however add simple code snippets (no longer than 10 lines of Python, JavaScript or HTML) relevant to meme humor contextually.
- Track engagements for these posts over the first week alongside those from Group A. 

---

### Metric:
Calculate viral engagement using metrics like likes per post and shares received by a given day.

**Viral Rate Calculation:**
Percentage increase in virality of memes with code snippets (Group B) compared to traditional meme formats without coding content ((group B - group A)/group A * 100).

We aim for an observable difference that shows Group B posts go viral faster, so we are looking at a metric where the engagement rate increases by X% after Y days. For example: "After one week (7 days), memes with code snippets had received twice as many likes/shares compared to those without."

### Decision Rule:
If our observed increase in virality is statistically significant and exceeds 20%, then H4 ("Memes containing simple, humorous coding go viral faster.") holds true.

# Hypothesis Testing Experiment for "Aggressive Copy Converts Better than Polite Copy"

## HYPOTHESIS
**H1:** Aggressive copy converts better (measured by conversion rate) compared to polite copy.

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED
To test this hypothesis, we need the following data points:
- Number of aggressive copies sent.
- Conversion rates for each individual aggression level in these emails/conversions/purchases/registrations/etc. tracked over time or a significant sample size (e.g., thousands).

## FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Smallest Test to Get 80% Confidence
To achieve an 80% confidence interval with the smallest test, you should consider conducting two large-scale A/B tests simultaneously.

### Methodology:
1. Split your audience into three groups randomly.
   - Group 1 receives a polite copy (control).
   - Groups 2 and 3 receive varying levels of aggressive copies respectively: 
     * Subgroup 2-A: mild aggression
     * Subgroup 2-B: moderate aggression  
     * Subgroup 2-C: high aggression

Each subgroup should have at least tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands respondents.

### Sample Sizes:
- Group 1 (polite copy): At least X thousand participants.
- Groups 2-A, 2-B and 2-C (aggressive copies) collectively aim for Y additional total sample size (~300k minimum combined).

**Note:** The larger the number surveyed in each subgroup within this small test range (<1000), quicker results can be achieved. For precise confidence intervals with a smaller set of respondents:

* You would ideally need around X * 8 to achieve an estimated precision interval for aggressive copy vs polite, as opposed to Y + Z combinations.

## METRIC
The exact number or percentage we should watch is:
- **Conversion rate (CR):** This metric shows the effectiveness in achieving desired goals like purchases/registrations/clicks.
  
Specifically look at conversion rates CR_Age_Group_X_Y for both aggressive and polite copies against baseline controls. 

### Decision Rule: If X, then Y

You should analyze if there is a statistically significant difference (p-value < 0.05) in the average Conversion Rates across varying aggression levels vs polite copy.

**If Aggressive Copy Averages significantly higher CRs than Polite with p-values less than .05**, H1 holds true and we conclude that aggressive copies convert better on an average level compared to a politeness baseline.

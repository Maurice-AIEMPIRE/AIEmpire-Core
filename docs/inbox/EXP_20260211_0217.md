# Experiment Design for Testing Hypothesis

## HYPOTHESIS
Aggressive copy converts better than polite copy by at least 20%.

### EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
- Conversion rate of aggressive copies (CR_A)
- Conversion rate of polite copies (CR_P)

We need to collect data on the number of clicks and conversions from both types.

1. Number of impressions for each type.
2. Click-through rates (CTR) for each type: `CR_A = CTR_A * Impressions_A` and similarly, CR_P = CTR_P * Impressions_P
3. Conversion rate calculation based on total visits converted by aggressive copy versus polite copy:
   - Conversions from Aggressive Copy (`C_A`) : Total Clicks via A / Number of impressions for Type-A.
   - Conversions from Polite Copy (`C_P`): Total Clicks via P / Number of impressions for Type-P.

### FASTEST EXPERIMENT
1. Run a controlled experiment with both aggressive and polite copy variants shown to similar groups, ideally randomized (to avoid biases).
2. Simultaneously run this test across multiple platforms or channels if possible.
3. Collect data over 7 days initially: split the impressions equally between Type-A and P-type ads for each platform/channel.

### METRIC
- Goal is achieving a minimum conversion improvement of at least +20% in aggressive copy versus polite copies, which can be summarized as:
   - CR_A = CTR_A * Impressions_A > (CTR_P * Impressions_P) + 0.2

The metric we need to monitor closely: `CR_A vs CR_P`

### DECISION RULE
- If the difference between Conversion Rates is statistically significant and greater than or equal to a threshold of at least **+20%**,
   - then proceed with using aggressive copy as it converts better.
- Else, revert back to polite copies.

Note:
1. Ensure sufficient sample size for robust conclusions (at least 1000 impressions per variant if split equally between Type-A and P-type ads).
2. Validate statistically significant differences by applying appropriate statistical tests like Chi-squared test or t-test based on collected data points.
3. Consider confounding variables, e.g., time-of-day effects; ensure randomization to minimize bias.

### Summary
1. HYPOTHESIS: Aggressive copy converts better than polite copies with a minimum of 20% improvement in conversion rates (CR_A vs CR_P).
2. EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
   - Number impressions and clicks for each type.
3. FASTEST EXPERIMENT: Randomized split-test across platforms/channels, collected over initial period spanning at least one week or until reaching the desired confidence level of 80%.
4. METRIC: Conversion rates (CR_A vs CR_P) to monitor closely with a goal threshold improvement set as +20% for aggressive copy.
5. DECISION RULE:
   - If observed conversion rate difference ≥+20%, then adopt Aggressive Copy strategy; otherwise, re-evaluate and possibly maintain Polite Copy approach.

Note: Additional metrics like Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) or Return On Investment (ROI) could also be considered depending on specific business goals. Adjust experiment duration to ensure desired confidence level is reached.

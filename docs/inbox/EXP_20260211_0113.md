# Experiment Design

## Hypothesis
H1: Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite copy.

## Evidence Required
- Number of clicks on aggressive copies vs number of clicks on polite copies for each ad instance. This data point is essential to compare the effectiveness between different types of writing styles in advertising campaigns.
  
## Fastest Experiment
To achieve an 80% confidence level with minimal test duration, we need a sample size that can statistically show significant differences at this threshold.

For simplicity and assuming normal distribution:
- We use Cohen's d for effect sizes (moderate effect = 0.5).
- Standard deviation is assumed to be approximately the average clicks difference observed in preliminary studies or pilot tests.
  
Using online calculators, we find an approximate sample size needed per group: around **64** ads of each type.

Therefore:
1. Create two groups with roughly equal number (e.g., Google Ads) but different copy types for 10 days to ensure enough data and variability due to time effect.
2. Randomly assign the same amount of aggressive vs polite copies among your targeted audience segments daily, ensuring randomization across ads served per day.

## Metric
- Click-through rate (CTR). We want CTR on aggressive > X% where this represents a 20% improvement over politeness copy assuming baseline politeness conversion is Y%.
  
Let's say the initial expected average from pilot tests suggests that polite copies have an average of **1.5%** with variation ~2%. Aiming for roughly double to indicate effectiveness:
- Aggressive: Target CTR > X = (Y * 20/100) + Y => Baseline politeness copy's conversion rate is assumed here.
  
So, we need aggressive ad’s target performance metric at least **3.0%**.

## Decision Rule
If the observed average click-through rates for:
- Polite ads <= baseline (1.5%)
- Aggressive > 3%

Then H1 can be accepted: "Aggressive copy converts better than polite by more significant percentage."

Summary:

### Hypothesis Testing Experiment

#### **Hypothesis**
H1: “Aggressive copy converts 20% better than polite.”

**Required Data Points**

We need the number of clicks for aggressive copies and polite versions to compare conversion rates across similar audience segments.

**Fastest Test Design (Sample Size)**:
Using Cohen’s d, we estimate around ~64 ads per variant are needed. Random assignment over roughly a week would be ideal given ad serving platforms' typical variation patterns observed in pilot studies or previous campaigns for the targeted segment(s).

We expect aggressive copies to surpass polite counterparts by 20% as baseline politeness rates hover near **1-2%** with variations around ~0.5%-3%.

### Key Metric and Decision Rule
Click-through rate (CTR) is our primary metric.

Decision rule: 
If observed average CTR for Aggressive = X > Baseline + 20%, we conclude H1, indicating aggressive copy converts better than polite by targeted percentage improvement margin.

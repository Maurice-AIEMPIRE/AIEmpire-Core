Need professional guidance on fire alarm systems? I offer remote consulting from someone who has designed, installed, tested, and maintained complex fire safety systems for 16 years. Whether you're optimizing an existing system, planning an upgrade, or implementing AI-driven safety monitoring, you're getting hands-on expertise from a certified Elektrotechnikmeister (German Master Electrician).

I specialize in Esser and Hekatron systems—the industry standard in Europe—and I bring a modern perspective on how AI and data analytics can enhance your fire safety operations. No theoretical handwaving; every recommendation is backed by real-world installation and maintenance experience.

- **Digitalization Roadmap**: Strategy for integrating IoT sensors, cloud monitoring, and smart alerts
- **Training & Documentation**: Technical guidance for your facilities team on system operation and maintenance
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshooting of specific system issues and performance optimization

### Why Choose Me?
- **Certified Elektrotechnikmeister**: German Master Craftsman certification—the highest level of electrical systems expertise
- **16 Years Hands-On Experience**: Not academic theory, but real installations, service calls, and complex problem-solving
- **Esser & Hekatron Specialist**: Deep knowledge of the most reliable fire alarm systems used in European facilities

### Unique Value Proposition
Most fire alarm consultants are either pure technicians (no business perspective) or sales-driven integrators.

## GIG 2 - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q1: What qualifications do you have for fire safety consulting?**
A: I'm a certified Elektrotechnikmeister (German Master Electrician), which is the highest technical certification for electrical systems. I have 16 years of hands-on experience with Esser and Hekatron BMA systems, including design, installation, testing, and maintenance. I'm familiar with EN 54 standards, VdS certification requirements, and European safety regulations.

**Q2: Will your recommendations require expensive equipment replacement?**
A: Not necessarily. My goal is to optimize what you have. Many recommendations focus on configuration improvements, maintenance optimization, and smarter monitoring—not replacement. Of course, if equipment is genuinely outdated or failing, I'll be direct about that. Honest assessment over costly solutions.

**Q3: Can you help with systems other than Esser and Hekatron?**
A: Yes, absolutely. While those are my specialties, the principles of fire alarm system design are consistent. I can assess most BMA systems (Siemens, Honeywell, etc.), though I may provide more detailed insights on Esser/Hekatron systems.

## GIG 3 - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q1: How is this different from ChatGPT or a template chatbot builder?**
A: ChatGPT is general-purpose. I build agents specifically trained on YOUR business processes, integrated with YOUR systems, running continuously without per-message costs, and returning answers in YOUR format. Template builders give you a basic chatbot. I give you a custom solution designed for your specific problems. Think of it as custom software vs. off-the-shelf tools.

**Q2: What if I need changes after delivery?**
A: That's normal and expected. The Support period includes bug fixes and minor adjustments. For major changes, we can discuss additional work. The Premium package includes unlimited revisions during the project, so you can iterate until it's perfect before deployment.

**Q3: Can you integrate with my specific systems (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)?**
A: In most cases, yes. I work with major CRMs, databases, APIs, and business systems. Before we start, I'll confirm that integration with your specific tools is possible. If there are custom or legacy systems, we may need to discuss alternative approaches, but I'll be upfront about that from day one.

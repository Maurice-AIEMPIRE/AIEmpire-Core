### Lack of Customized Scripts for Different Stages and Scenarios

The main problem many sales professionals face is the lack of tailored scripts that cover every possible stage in their unique situation.
 
Even experienced sellers struggle to come up with convincing pitches during meetings due to uncertainty about what customers want or how best to persuade them.

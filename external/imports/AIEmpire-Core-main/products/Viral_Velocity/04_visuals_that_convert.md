### 1. **The Power of High Contrast**

High contrast grabs attention faster than anything else—perfect when you're looking at social media feeds.

#### Implementation:

Create visuals with stark differences between colors or tones using Adobe Illustrator:
```plaintext
1. Open a new document.
2. Select the Rectangle Tool (M).
3. Draw two rectangles: one dark and another light for high contrast backgrounds (#000 vs #FFF).
4. Add text on top, ensuring it's readable against both background shades.
```

### 2. **Optimal Image Size & Formats**

Different platforms prefer different image sizes; knowing this saves precious seconds.

#### Implementation:

- For Instagram posts: Resize images to a maximum of 1080x1358 pixels in JPG format
- Use PNG for transparent backgrounds on websites

Command-line quick check (for Mac users):
```bash
sips -z max /path/to/your/image.jpg --out resized_image.png && sips -z 600k resize_placeholder.png >> image_sizes.txt || echo "Image too large"
```

### 3. **Color Psychology in Marketing**

Colors evoke emotions—know your target audience to hit the right notes.

#### Implementation:

- Blue: Trust & security (use on banks, tech companies)
- Green: Growth/reliability (ideal for eco-friendly brands)

Use a color wheel tool like Adobe Color:
```plaintext
1. Go to https://color.adobe.com/
2. Click "Create" and input the primary emotion or theme of your campaign.
3. Pick colors that align with this mood/emotion from suggested palette.
```

---

### 4. **Infographics: Storytelling Through Data**

Turn complex data into digestible, engaging stories.

#### Implementation:

Use tools like Canva to design an infographic:
```plaintext
1. Choose a template related to your content (e.g., "Statistics").
2. Insert relevant graphics and text.
3. Use high-contrast colors for readability—solid against light backgrounds or vice versa.
```

---

### 5. **Video Editing: Hooking the Audience**

A well-edited video can be as compelling in seconds.

#### Implementation:

Leverage editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro:
```plaintext
1. Import your raw footage into a new project (File > New Project).
2. Drag clips onto the timeline.
3. Trim and sync using cut, split points for seamless transitions between scenes.
```

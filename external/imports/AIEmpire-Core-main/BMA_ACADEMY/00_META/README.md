# BMA Knowledge Fortress (BMA Academy)

## Vision
To build Germany's leading knowledge platform for Fire Alarm Systems (Brandmeldeanlagen - BMA), transforming 15+ years of expert project data into a structured, queryable knowledge base.

## Goals
1.  **Structure Chaos**: Organize legacy project data (2018-2024) into a clean, logical system.
2.  **Extract Wisdom**: Use AI agents to mine patterns, best practices, and solutions from raw files.
3.  **Build Products**: Create authoritative content for online courses, community Q&A, and expert consulting.

## The "Fortress" Concept
This project is built as a fortress:
-   **Foundation**: Solid data structure (`00_META`, `03_KNOWLEDGE_BASE`).
-   **Walls**: The content itself, structured by theory and practice.
-   **Moat**: Quality assurance processes to ensure accuracy.
-   **Towers**: Specialized agent squads monitoring and building the system.

## Setup
This repository serves as the Blueprint for future knowledge projects.
The structure is designed to be modular and scalable.
